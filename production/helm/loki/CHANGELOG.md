- [BUGFIX] Remove unreleased setting `useFederatedToken` from Azure configuration block.

## 4.6

## 4.5.1

- [BUGFIX] Fix rendering of namespace in provisioner job.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Allow to configure `publishNotReadyAddresses` on memberlist service.
- [BUGFIX] Correctly set `compactor_address` for 3 target scalable configuration.

## 4.5

- [ENHANCEMENT] Single binary mode is now possible for more than 1 replica, with a gateway and object storage backend.

## 4.4.2

- [CHANGE] Bump Loki version to 2.7.2 and GEL version to 1.6.1

## 4.4.1

- [BUGFIX] Fix a few problems with the included dashboards and allow the rules to be created in a different namespace (which may be necessary based on how your Prometheus Operator is deployed).

## 4.1.1

- [FEATURE] Added `loki.runtimeConfig` helm values to provide a reloadable runtime configuration.

## 4.1

- [BUGFIX] Fix bug in provisioner job that caused the self-monitoring tenant secret to be created with an empty token.

## 4.0

- [FEATURE] Added `enterprise.adminToken.additionalNamespaces` which are a list of additional namespaces to create secrets containing the GEL admin token in. This is especially useful if your Grafana instance is in another namespace.
- [CHANGE] **BREAKING** Remove `enterprise.nginxConfig.file`. Both enterprise and gateway configurations now share the same nginx config, use `gateway.nginxConfig.file` for both. Admin routes will 404 on OSS deployments.
- [CHANGE] **BREAKING** Default simple deployment mode to new, 3 target configuration (read, write, and backend). This new configuration allows the `read` target to be run as a deployment and auto-scaled. To go back to the legacy, 2 target configuration, set `read.legacyReadTraget` to `true`.
- [CHANGE] **BREAKING** Change how tenants are defined
- [CHANGE] **BREKAING** Remove `enterprise.adminTokenSecret`. This is now defined under `enterprise.adminToken.secret`.
- [CHANGE] **BREKAING** Rename and change format of `enterprise.provisioner.tenants`. Property has been renamed to `enterprise.provisioner.additionalTenants`, and is now an array of objects rather than string. Each object must contain a `name` and a `secretNamespace` field, where `name` is the name of the tenant and `secretNamespace` is the namespace to create the secret with the tenant's read and write token.
- [CHANGE] **BREAKING** Change the structure of `monitoring.selfMonitoring.tenant` from a string to an object. The new object must have a `name` and a `secretNamespace` field, where `name` is the name of the self-monitoring tenant and `secretNamespace` is the namespace to create an additional secret with the tenant's token. A secret will still also be created in the release namespace as it's needed by the Loki canary.
- [CHANGE] **BREAKING** Remove ability to create self-monitoring resources in different namespaces (with the exception of dashboard configmaps).

## 3.10.0

- [CHANGE] Deprecate `enterprise.nginxConfig.file`. Both enterprise and gateway configurations now share the same nginx config. Admin routes will 404 on OSS deployments. Will be removed in version 4 of the chart, please use `gateway.nginxConfig.file` for both OSS and Enterprise gateways.
- [FEATURE] Added new simple deployment target `backend`. Running 3 targets for simple deployment will soon be the default in Loki. This new target allows the `read` target to be run as a deployment and auto-scaled.

## 3.9.0

- [BUGFIX] Fix race condition between minio create bucket job and enterprise tokengen job

## 3.8.2

- [BUGFIX] Fix autoscaling/v2 template
- [FEATURE] Added `extraObjects` helm values to extra manifests.

## 3.8.1

- [ENHANCEMENT] Add the ability to specify container lifecycle

## 3.8.0

- [BUGFIX] Added `helm-weight` annotations to the tokengen and provisioner jobs to make sure tokengen always runs before provisioner

## 3.7.0

**BREAKING**: Configuration values for Loki Canary moved from `monitoring.selfMonitoring.lokiCanary` to `monitoring.lokiCanary`

- [ENHANCEMENT] Decouple the Loki Canary from the self-monitoring setup, which adds an unnecessary dependency on the Grafana Agent Operator.

## 3.6.1

## 3.2.0

- [CHANGE] Bump Grafana Enterprise Logs version to v1.5.2

## 3.1.0

- [FEATURE] Loki canary and GEL token provisioner added. The GEL token provisioner will provision a tenant and token to be used by the self-monitoring features (including the canary), as well as any additional tenants specified. A k8s secret will be created with a read and write token for each additional tenant specified.

## 3.0.4

- [CHANGE] Default minio replicas to 1 node with 2 drives. The old config used the default, which was 16 nodes with 1 drive each.
- [BUGFIX] Minio subchart values `accessKey` and `secretKey` were removed in the new chart and replaced with `rootUser` and `rootPassword`.
- [CHANGE] The tokengen job no longer creates a `grafana-token`, as the base64 encoding was not working in a Grafana Enterprise GEL plugin installation.

## 3.0.0

- [CHANGE] Loki helm chart was moved to this location in the Loki repo. The chart now supports both
[single binary](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/loki) and [simple scalable](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/loki-simple-scalable) deployment modes. For changes prior to version 3.0.0, please
look in the respective deprectated [single binary](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/loki) and [simple scalable](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/loki-simple-scalable/CHANGELOG.md) charts.
