// Package logical provides a logical query plan representation for data
// processing operations.
//
// The logical plan is represented using static single-assignment (SSA) form of
// intermediate representation (IR) for the operations performed on log data.
//
// For an introduction to SSA form, see
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form.
//
// The primary interfaces of this package are:
//
// - [Value], an expression that yields a value.
// - [Instruction], a statement that consumes values and performs computation.
// - [Plan], a sequence of instructions that produces a result.
//
// A computation that also yields a result implements both the [Value] and
// [Instruction] interfaces. See the documentation comments on each type for
// which of those interfaces it implements.
//
// Values are representable as either:
//
// - A column value (such as in [ColumnRef]),
// - a relation (such as in [Select]), or
// - a value literal (such as in [Literal]).
//
// The SSA form forms a graph: each [Value] may appear as an operand of one or
// more [Instruction]s.

// An Instruction is an SSA instruction that computes a new [Value] or has some
// effect.
//
// Instructions that define a value (e.g., BinOp) also implement the Value
// interface; an Instruction that only has an effect (e.g., Return) does not.
type Instruction interface {
	// String returns the disassembled SSA form of the Instruction. This does not
	// include the name of the Value if the Instruction also implements [Value].
	String() string

	// isInstruction is a marker method to prevent external implementations.
	isInstruction()
}

// A Value is an SSA value that can be referenced by an [Instruction].
type Value interface {
	// Name returns an identifier for this Value (such as "%1"), which is used
	// when this Value appears as an operand of an Instruction.
	//
	// If the Value was not created by the logical planner, Name instead returns
	// the pointer address of the Value.
	Name() string

	// String returns human-readable information about the Value. If Value also
	// implements [Instruction], String returns the disassembled form of the
	// Instruction as documented by [Instruction.String].
	String() string

	// Schema returns the type of this Value.
