// Slimgester is a slimmed-down version of the ingester, intended to
// ingest logs without WALs. Broadly, it accumulates logs into per-tenant chunks in the same way the existing ingester does,
// without a WAL. Index (TSDB) creation is also not an out-of-band procedure and must be called directly. In essence, this
// allows us to buffer data, flushing chunks to storage as necessary, and then when ready to commit this, relevant TSDBs (one per period) are created and flushed to storage. This allows an external caller to prepare a batch of data, build relevant chunks+indices, ensure they're flushed, and then return. As long as chunk+index creation is deterministic, this operation is also
// idempotent, making retries simple and impossible to introduce duplicate data.
// It contains the following methods:
//   - `Append(context.Context, logproto.PushRequest) error`
//     Adds a push request to ingested data. May flush existing chunks when they're full/etc.
//   - `Commit(context.Context) error`
//     Serializes (cuts) any buffered data into chunks, flushes them to storage, then creates + flushes TSDB indices
//     containing all chunk references. Finally, clears internal state.
