// General purpose iteration over series. Makes it easier to build custom functionality on top of indices
// of different types without them all implementing the same feature.
// The passed callback must _not_ capture its arguments. They're reused for each call for performance.
// The passed callback may be executed concurrently,
// so any shared state must be protected by the caller.
// NB: This is a low-level API and should be used with caution.
// NB: It's possible for the callback to be called multiple times for the same series but possibly different chunks,
// such as when the Index is backed by multiple files with the same series present.
// NB(owen-d): mainly in this package to avoid circular dependencies elsewhere
