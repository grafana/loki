# This partial configuration uses IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) for chunk storage. 
# A trusted profile will be used for authenticating with COS. We can either pass
# the trusted profile name or trusted profile ID along with the compute resource token file.
# If we pass both trusted profile name and trusted profile ID it should be of 
# the same trusted profile.
# In order to use trusted profile authentication we need to follow an additional step to create a trusted profile.
# For more details about creating a trusted profile, see https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-create-trusted-profile&interface=ui.
