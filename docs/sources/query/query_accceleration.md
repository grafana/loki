# Query acceleration (Experimental)

{{% admonition type="warning" %}}
Query acceleration using blooms is an [experimental feature](/docs/release-life-cycle/). Engineering and on-call support is not available. No SLA is provided.
{{% /admonition %}}

If [bloom filters][] are enabled, you can write LogQL queries using [structured metadata][] to benefit from query acceleration.

## Prerequisites

* [Bloom filters][bloom filters] must be enabled.
* Logs must be sending [structured metadata][].

### Query blooms

Queries will be accelerated for any [label filter expression][] that satisfies _all_ of the following criteria:

* The label filter expression using **string equality**, such as `| key="value"`.
* The label filter expression is querying for structured metadata and not a stream label.
* The label filter expression is placed before any [parser expression][], [labels format expression][], [drop labels expression][], or [keep labels expression][].

To take full advantage of query acceleration with blooms, ensure that filtering structured metadata is done before any parse expression:

```logql
{cluster="prod"} | logfmt | json | detected_level="error"  # NOT ACCELERATED: structured metadata filter is after a parse stage
{cluster="prod"} | detected_level="error" | logfmt | json  # ACCELERATED: structured metadata filter is before any parse stage
```
