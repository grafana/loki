# v3.0

Grafana Labs and the Loki team are excited to announce the release of Loki 3.0. Here's a summary of new enhancements and important fixes.

For a full list of all changes and fixes, refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/release-3.0.0-rc1/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

Key features in Loki 3.0.0 include the following:

- **Query acceleration with Bloom filters** (experimental): This is designed to speed up filter queries, with best results for queries that are looking for a specific text string like an error message or UUID. For more information, refer to [Query acceleration with Blooms](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/operations/query-acceleration-blooms/).

- **Native OpenTelemetry Support**: A simplified ingestion pipeline (Loki Exporter no longer needed) and a more intuitive query experience for OTel logs. For more information, refer to the [OTEL documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/send-data/otel/).

- **Helm charts**: A major upgrade to the Loki helm chart introduces support for `Distributed` mode (also known as [microservices](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/get-started/deployment-modes/#microservices-mode) mode), includes memcached by default, and includes several updates to configurations to improve Loki operations.

- **Lambda/Promtail:** support dropping labels ([#10755](https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/10755)) ([ec54c72](https://github.com/grafana/loki/commit/ec54c723ebbeeda88000dde188d539ecfe05dad8)).

- **Docs improvements**: All the Getting Started topics have been revised, including a new [Quickstart](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/quick-start/) to help new users get up and running with Loki faster.The Storage, Configuration Reference, and API documentation have been updated to reflect deprecated and removed code, configuration options, and API endpoints.

## Deprecations

One of the focuses of Loki 3.0 was cleaning up unused code and old features that had been previously deprecated but not removed. Loki 3.0 removes a number of previous deprecations and introduces some new deprecations.  Some of the main areas with changes include:

- [Deprecated storage options](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/storage/) including the deprecation of the BoltDB store.

- [Deprecated configuration options](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/next/configure/).

- [API endpoint deprecations](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/next/reference/api/#deprecated-endpoints).

To learn more about breaking changes in this release, refer to the [Upgrade guide](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/next/setup/upgrade/).

## Upgrade Considerations

The path from 2.9 to 3.0 includes several breaking changes.  For important upgrade guideance, refer to the [Upgrade Guide](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/setup/upgrade/) and the separate [Helm Upgrade Guide](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/setup/upgrade/upgrade-to-6x/).
