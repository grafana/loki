# v3.0

Grafana Labs and the Loki team are excited to announce the release of Loki 3.0. Here's a summary of new enhancements and important fixes.

For a full list of all changes and fixes, refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/release-3.0.x/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features and enhancements

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
Note that Loki 3.0 defaults to using the v13 schema. All of the latest features are built against TSDB and the v13 Schema. This version of the schema is compatible with both Loki 2.9.x and Loki 3.0. The main change is to add support for Structured Metadata which is used by the new OTLP native endpoint and is enabled by default.

Key features in Loki 3.0.0 include the following:

- **Query acceleration with Bloom filters** (experimental): This is designed to speed up filter queries, with best results for queries that are looking for a specific text string like an error message or UUID. For more information, refer to [Query acceleration with Blooms](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/operations/query-acceleration-blooms/).

- **Native OpenTelemetry Support**: A simplified ingestion pipeline (Loki Exporter no longer needed) and a more intuitive query experience for OTel logs. For more information, refer to the [OTel documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/send-data/otel/).

- **Helm charts**: A major upgrade to the Loki helm chart introduces support for `Distributed` mode (also known as [microservices](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/get-started/deployment-modes/#microservices-mode) mode), includes memcached by default, and includes several updates to configurations to improve Loki operations.

- **Pattern match filter**: LogQL now supports two new [pattern match filter operators](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/query/#pattern-match-filter-operators). You can match any word with just one control character and it is simpler and 10x faster than using regex.

- **Caching updates**: This release includes multiple updates to caching to improve performance, add new configuration options and support for new features, deprecate features no longer needed, and add automatic background checks.

- **Lambda/Promtail:** Support dropping labels ([#10755](https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/10755)) ([ec54c72](https://github.com/grafana/loki/commit/ec54c723ebbeeda88000dde188d539ecfe05dad8)).

- **Profiling integration**: Added profiling integrations to tracing instrumentation to allow getting a profile for a single request.

- **Docs improvements**: All the Getting Started topics have been revised, including a new [Quickstart](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/get-started/quick-start/) to help new users get up and running with Loki faster. The Storage, Configuration Reference, and API documentation have been updated to reflect deprecated and removed code, configuration options, and API endpoints.

## Deprecations

One of the focuses of Loki 3.0 was cleaning up unused code and old features that had been previously deprecated but not removed. Loki 3.0 removes a number of previous deprecations and introduces some new deprecations. Some of the main areas with changes include:

- [Deprecated storage options](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/storage/) including the deprecation of the BoltDB store.

- [Deprecated configuration options](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/configure/).

- [API endpoint deprecations](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/reference/api/#deprecated-endpoints).

To learn more about breaking changes in this release, refer to the [Upgrade guide](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/setup/upgrade/).
