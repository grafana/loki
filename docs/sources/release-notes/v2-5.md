# V2.5

It has been nearly 6 months since Loki 2.4 was released, and we’ve been busy making Loki better than ever. Here's a summary of new enhancements and important fixes.

## Features and enhancements

- Thanks to @bboreham for taking a deep dive on the Go `regexp` library, and for creating a fork which greatly **[improves the performance of common regex uses cases in Loki.](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/5315)**
- **[Binary operations are now significantly faster](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/5317)**, taking full advantage of Loki's parallelism.
- **[A new schema is available](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/5054)**, which uses more path prefixes to avoid rate limits on S3.
- That same schema change **[was also added to the filesystem store](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/5291)**, which avoids using one directory to store every chunk.
- A new capability for **[hedging requests to storage](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/4826)** improves performance on highly parallelized queries. Refer to the [hedging configuration]({{<relref "../configuration/#storage_config">}}) under the `storage_config` block for more information.
- Promtail has several new ways to ingest logs:
    - The **[ability to do service discovery and tailing directly from the Docker daemon](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/4911)**.
    - **[Fetching logs directly from Cloudflare](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/4813)**.
    - **[Receiving logs directly in Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF)](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/4744)**.
- Promtail permits **[client-side global rate limiting](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/5031)** and **[pipeline-configurable rate limiting](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/5051)**.

For a full list of all changes please look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Upgrade Considerations

As always, please read the [upgrade guide]({{<relref "../upgrading/#250">}}) before upgrading Loki.

### Changes to the config `split_queries_by_interval`
The most likely impact many people will see is Loki failing to start because of a change in the YAML configuration for `split_queries_by_interval`. It was previously possible to define this value in two places.

```yaml
query_range:
  split_queries_by_interval: 10m
```

and/or

```yaml
limits_config:
  split_queries_by_interval: 10m
```

In 2.5.0 it can **only be defined in the `limits_config` section**. 

**Loki will fail to start if you do not remove the `split_queries_by_interval` configuration parameter from the `query_range` section.**

Additionally, it has a new default value of `30m` rather than `0`.

The CLI flag is not changed and remains `querier.split-queries-by-interval`.

### More parallelism by default

We continue to move defaults in Loki to leverage parallelism in all configurations, including the single binary.

In v2.5, all queries will be split and sharded by default. This will likely result in increased memory and CPU usage for Loki processes during queries, if you didn’t previously have these values enabled.

## Usage reporting

Loki 2.5 includes code we added to report anonymous usage statistics back to Grafana Labs, [an issue was created to outline the intent](https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/5062), and what went into the final implementation [can be seen here in the source](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/v2.5.0/pkg/usagestats/stats.go#L75).

Usage reporting helps provide anonymous information on how people use Loki and what the Loki team should focus on for features and documentation. No private information is collected, and all reports are completely anonymous. 

If possible, we ask you to leave the usage reporting feature enabled and help us understand more about Loki! We are also working to figure out how we can share this info with the community so everyone can watch Loki grow.

If you would rather not participate in usage stats reporting, [the feature can be disabled in config](/docs/loki/latest/configuration/#analytics)
