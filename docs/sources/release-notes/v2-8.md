# V2.8
Grafana Labs is excited to announce the release of Loki 2.8. Here's a summary of new enhancements and important fixes:

## Features and enhancements

- **TSDB index no longer experimental** After extensive testing of the new TSDB index in our Grafana Cloud Logs offering, we can safely announce that it is no longer experimental and encourage all Loki deployments to use it!
- **Query blocker** Queries can now be blocked in the Querier/Ruler via a per-tenant runtime configuration.
- **New `backend` target** A new, third target was added to Loki's _scalable_ configuration, which is the default configuration used in the Loki helm chart. This allows Loki to be run as 3 targets (`read`, `write`, and `backend`) and makes the `read` target stateless and therefore able to be run as a Kubernetes deployment that can be scaled automatically.


For a full list of all changes please look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
