# V2.8
Grafana Labs is excited to announce the release of Loki 2.8. Here's a summary of new enhancements and important fixes:

## Features and enhancements

- **TSDB index no longer experimental** After extensive testing of the new TSDB index in our Grafana Cloud Logs offering, we can safely announce that it is no longer experimental and encourage all Loki deployments to use it!
- **Remote rule evaluation** Rules can now be evaluated against a configured `query-frontend`, allowing these queries to be executed with all the parallelisation & optimisation that regular adhoc queries have.
- **Rule evaluation jitter** Rulers now expose a configurable random sleep before each rule evaluation to prevent contention on the query engine should multiple runs execute concurrently.
- **Hierarchical scheduler queues** The scheduler queues are now hierarchical, allowing QoS (query fairness) controls within the same tenant via the `X-Actor-Path` header.
- **Query blocker** Queries can now be blocked in the Querier/Ruler via a per-tenant runtime configuration.
- **Query max bytes read limit** Two new per-tenant limits were added to protect queriers from reading too much data when using the TSDB index. Setting `max_query_bytes_read` will refuse queries that will read more than the value configured. Setting `max_querier_bytes_read` will refuse queries whose subqueries would read more than the configured value after splitting and sharding. These limits leverage features of the TSDB index and therefore are only available when using TSDB.
- **Require number of labels per query** A new per-tenant limit was introduced to require a certain number of labels on a query.
- **New `backend` target** A new, third target was added to Loki's _scalable_ configuration, which is the default configuration used in the Loki helm chart. This allows Loki to be run as 3 targets (`read`, `write`, and `backend`) and makes the `read` target stateless and therefore able to be run as a Kubernetes deployment that can be scaled automatically.
