# Version 2.4 release notes

With Loki 2.4 we’ve focused on 2 main things:

1. Making it easier than ever to get your logs into Loki. 
2. Making it easier to run and operate, anyone not using Kubernetes or allergic to microservices should pay close attention, this release has a lot for you.

## Features and enhancements

* [**Loki no longer requires logs to be sent in perfect chronological order.**](../../configuration/#accept-out-of-order-writes) Support for out of order logs is one of the most highly requested features for Loki and in 2.4 the strict ordering constraint has been removed.
* Scaling Loki is now much easier with a hybrid mode between a single binary and microservices we are calling the [**Simple Scalable Deployment**](../../fundamentals/architecture/#modes-of-operation). It’s now possible to scale Loki with new `read` and `write` targets. Where previously you would have needed Kubernetes and the microservices approach to start tapping into Loki’s potential, it’s now possible to do this in a much simpler way.
* We introduced a [common config section](../../configuration/#common_config) and updated and updated a lot of defaults. The result is a working **Loki config can now be about 70% smaller** and comes out of the box with more appropriate defaults and limits.
* **[Recording rules](../../rules/#recording-rules) are no longer marked experimental** and have a much more resilient implementation which leverages the existing write ahead log code in Prometheus.
* Do you use Kafka for your logs? You should check out the new [**Promtail Kafka Consumer**](../../clients/promtail/scraping/#kafka) which can easily get your logs out of Kafka and into Loki.
* **LogQL has received some nice enhancements** thanks to the amazing Loki community in the form of [group_left and group_right](../../logql/#many-to-one-and-one-to-many-vector-matches) as well as  the `label_format` and `line_format`functions now support [working with dates and times](../../logql/template_functions/#now)
* Another great community contribution to Promtail allows it to [**accept ndjson and plaintext log files over HTTP**](../../clients/promtail/configuration/#loki_push_api).

All in all about 260 PR’s went into Loki 2.4 and we thank everyone for helping us make the best Loki yet.

For a full list of all changes please look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#240-20211105)

## Upgrade Considerations

Please read the [upgrade guide](../../upgrading/#240) before updating Loki.

We made a lot of changes to Loki’s configuration as part of this release, we have tried our best to make sure changes are compatible with existing configurations however some changes to default limits may impact users who didn't have values explicitly set for these limits in their config files.

Here is a list of limits changed:

| config | new default | old default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ingestion_rate_strategy | "global" | "local" |
| max_global_streams_per_user | 5000 | 0 (no limit) |
| max_query_length | "721h" | "0h" (no limit) |
| max_query_parallelism | 32 | 14 |
| max_streams_per_user | 0 (no limit) | 10000 |
| reject_old_samples | true | false |
| reject_old_samples_max_age | "168h" | "336h" |
| per_stream_rate_limit | 3MB | - |
| per_stream_rate_limit_burst | 15MB | - |

Also we have enabled the [in-memory FIFO cache by default](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/4519) when no existing external cache is configured. This helps improve Loki's performance however it will also allow Loki to consume more memory.

[4627](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/4627) Loki: Explicitly define allowed HTTP methods on HTTP endpoints

A community user noticed that all Loki endpoints would respond to HTTP OPTIONS requests, and the proxy they placed in front of Loki responsible for HTTP authentication would pass OPTIONS requests unauthenticated to Loki allowing users to make unauthenticated/unauthorized queries to Loki. This PR restricts the type of HTTP methods allowed on each endpoint and disallows OPTIONS requests.
