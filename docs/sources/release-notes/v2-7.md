# Version 2.7 release notes

Grafana Labs is excited to announce the release of Loki 2.7. Here's a summary of new enhancements and important fixes:

## Features and enhancements

- **New Internal Server and TLS** TLS can now be configured everywhere and there is an internal server to allow ring, memberlist, and readiness handlers to continue to work without TLS.
- **Better Support for Azure Blob Storage** thanks to the ability to use Azure's Service Principal Credentials.
- **Logs can now be pushed from the Loki canary** so you don't have to rely on a scraping service to use the canary.
- **Additional `label_format` fields** `__timestamp__` and `__line__`.
- **`fifocache` has been renamed** The in-memory `fifocache` has been renamed to `embedded-cache`. Check [upgrade guide](../../upgrading/#270) for more details
- **New HTTP endpoint for Ingester shutdown** that will also delete the ring token.
- **Faster label queries** thanks to new parallization.
- **Introducing Stream Sharding** an experimental new feature to help deal with very large streams.
- **Promtail**
  - support for max stream limit
  - config reload endpoint / signal
  - compressed file support
  - `lambda-promtail` now supports Kinesis data stream events
  - matches for the journal reader
  - basic tracing support
