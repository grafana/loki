# Loki Storage Retention

Retention in Loki is achieved either through the [Table Manager](#table-manager) or the [Compactor](#Compactor).


Retention through the [Table Manager](../table-manager/) is achieved by relying on the object store TTL feature, and will work for both [boltdb-shipper](../boltdb-shipper) store and chunk/index store. However retention through the [Compactor](../boltdb-shipper#compactor) is supported only with the [boltdb-shipper](../boltdb-shipper) store.

The [Compactor](#Compactor) retention will become the default and have long term support. While this retention is still **experimental**, it supports more granular retention policies on per tenant and per stream use cases.

## Compactor

The [Compactor](../boltdb-shipper#compactor) can deduplicate index entries. It can also apply granular retention. When applying retention with the Compactor, the [Table Manager](../table-manager/) is unnecessary.

> Run the compactor as a singleton (a single instance).

Compaction and retention are idempotent. If the compactor restarts, it will continue from where it left off.

The Compactor loops to apply compaction and retention at every `compaction_interval`, or as soon as possible if running behind.

The compactor's algorithm to update the index:

- For each table within each day:
  - Compact the table into a single index file.
  - Traverse the entire index. Use the tenant configuration to identify and mark chunks that need to be removed.
  - Remove marked chunks from the index and save their reference in a file on disk.
  - Upload the new modified index files.

The retention algorithm is applied to the index. Chunks are not deleted while applying the retention algorithm. The chunks will be deleted by the compactor asynchronously when swept.

Marked chunks will only  be deleted after `retention_delete_delay` configured is expired because:

1. boltdb-shipper indexes are refreshed from the shared store on components using it (querier and ruler) at a specific interval. This means deleting chunks instantly could lead to components still having reference to old chunks and so they could fails to execute queries. Having a delay allows for components to refresh their store and so remove gracefully their reference of those chunks.

2. It gives you a short period to cancel chunks deletion in case of mistakes.

Marked chunks will only  be deleted after `retention_delete_delay` configured is expired because

- boltdb-shipper indexes are refreshed from the shared store on components using them (querier and ruler) at a specific interval. Deleting chunks instantly could lead to components still having a reference to old chunks. This could, in turn, cause query execution failure. Having a delay allows components to refresh their store and gracefully remove their reference to those chunks.

- It provides a short window of time in which to cancel chunk deletion in the case of a configuration mistake.

Marker files (containing chunks to delete) should be stored on a persistent disk, since the disk will be the sole reference to them.

### Retention Configuration

This compactor configuration example activates retention.

```yaml
compactor:
  working_directory: /data/retention
  shared_store: gcs
  compaction_interval: 10m
  retention_enabled: true
  retention_delete_delay: 2h
  retention_delete_worker_count: 150
schema_config:
    configs:
      - from: "2020-07-31"
        index:
            period: 24h
            prefix: loki_index_
        object_store: gcs
        schema: v11
        store: boltdb-shipper
storage_config:
    boltdb_shipper:
        active_index_directory: /data/index
        cache_location: /data/boltdb-cache
        shared_store: gcs
    gcs:
        bucket_name: loki
```

> Note that retention is only available if the index period is 24h.

Set `retention_enabled` to true. Without this, the Compactor will only compact tables.

Define `schema_config` and `storage_config` to access the storage.

The index period must be 24h.

`working_directory` is the directory where marked chunks and temporary tables will be saved.

`compaction_interval` dictates how often compaction and/or retention is applied. If the Compactor falls behind, compaction and/or retention occur as soon as possible.

`retention_delete_delay` is the delay after which the compactor will delete marked chunks.

`retention_delete_worker_count` specifies the maximum quantity of goroutine workers instantiated to delete chunks.

#### Configuring the retention period

Retention period is configured within the [`limits_config`](./../../../configuration/#limits_config) configuration section.

There are two ways of setting retention policies:

- `retention_period` which is applied globally.
- `retention_stream` which is only applied to chunks matching the selector

> The minimum retention period is 24h.

This example configures global retention:

```yaml
...
limits_config:
  retention_period: 744h
  retention_stream:
  - selector: '{namespace="dev"}'
    priority: 1
    period: 24h
  per_tenant_override_config: /etc/overrides.yaml
...
```

Per tenant retention can be defined using the `/etc/overrides.yaml` files. For example:

```yaml
overrides:
    "29":
        retention_period: 168h
        retention_stream:
        - selector: '{namespace="prod"}'
          priority: 2
          period: 336h
        - selector: '{container="loki"}'
          priority: 1
          period: 72h
    "30":
        retention_stream:
        - selector: '{container="nginx"}'
          priority: 1
          period: 24h
```

A rule to apply is selected by choosing the first in this list that matches:

1. If a per-tenant `retention_stream` matches the current stream, the highest priority is picked.
2. If a global `retention_stream` matches the current stream, the highest priority is picked.
3. If a per-tenant `retention_period` is specified, it will be applied.
4. The global `retention_period` will be selected if nothing else matched.
5. If no global `retention_period` is specified, the default value of `744h` (30days) retention is used.

Stream matching uses the same syntax as Prometheus label matching:

- `=`: Select labels that are exactly equal to the provided string.
- `!=`: Select labels that are not equal to the provided string.
- `=~`: Select labels that regex-match the provided string.
- `!~`: Select labels that do not regex-match the provided string.

The example configurations will set these rules:

- All tenants except `29` and `30` in the `dev` namespace will have a retention period of `24h` hours.
- All tenants except `29` and `30` that are not in the `dev` namespace will have the retention period of `744h`.
- For tenant `29`:
  - All streams except those in the container `loki` or in the namespace `prod` will have retention period of `168h` (1 week).
  - All streams in the `prod` namespace will have a retention period of `336h` (2 weeks), even if the container label is `loki`, since the priority of the `prod` rule is higher.
  - Streams that have the container label `loki` but are not in the namespace `prod` will have a `72h` retention period.
- For tenant `30`:
  - All streams except those having the container label `nginx` will have the global retention period of `744h`, since there is no override specified.
  - Streams that have the label `nginx` will have a retention period of `24h`.

## Table Manager

In order to enable the retention support, the Table Manager needs to be
configured to enable deletions and a retention period. Please refer to the
[`table_manager_config`](../../../configuration#table_manager_config)
section of the Loki configuration reference for all available options.
Alternatively, the `table-manager.retention-period` and
`table-manager.retention-deletes-enabled` command line flags can be used. The
provided retention period needs to be a duration represented as a string that
can be parsed using Go's [time.Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

> **WARNING**: The retention period must be a multiple of the index and chunks table
`period`, configured in the [`period_config`](../../../configuration#period_config)
block. See the [Table Manager](../table-manager#retention) documentation for
more information.

> **NOTE**: To avoid querying of data beyond the retention period,
`max_look_back_period` config in [`chunk_store_config`](../../../configuration#chunk_store_config) must be set to a value less than or equal to
what is set in `table_manager.retention_period`.

When using S3 or GCS, the bucket storing the chunks needs to have the expiry
policy set correctly. For more details check
[S3's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)
or
[GCS's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managing-lifecycles).

Currently, the retention policy can only be set globally. A per-tenant retention
policy with an API to delete ingested logs is still under development.

Since a design goal of Loki is to make storing logs cheap, a volume-based
deletion API is deprioritized. Until this feature is released, if you suddenly
must delete ingested logs, you can delete old chunks in your object store. Note,
however, that this only deletes the log content and keeps the label index
intact; you will still be able to see related labels but will be unable to
retrieve the deleted log content.

For further details on the Table Manager internals, refer to the
[Table Manager](../table-manager/) documentation.
