# Block unwanted queries

In certain situations, you may not be able to control the queries being sent to your Loki installation. These queries
may be intentionally or unintentionally expensive to run, and they may affect the overall stability or cost of running
your service.

You can block queries using [per-tenant overrides](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/configure/#runtime-configuration-file), like so:

```yaml
overrides:
  "tenant-id":
    blocked_queries:
      # block this query exactly
      - pattern: 'sum(rate({env="prod"}[1m]))'

      # block any query matching this regex pattern 
      - pattern: '.*prod.*'
        regex: true

      # block all metric queries
      - types: metric

      # block any filter or limited queries matching this regex pattern 
      - pattern: '.*prod.*'
        regex: true
        types: filter,limited

      # block any query that matches this query hash
      - hash: 2943214005          # hash of {stream="stdout",pod="loki-canary-9w49x"}
        types: filter,limited

      # block queries originating from specific sources via X-Query-Tags
      # Keys and values are matched case-insensitively.
      - pattern: '.*'             # optional; if pattern and regex are omittied they will default to '.*' and true
        regex: true
        tags:
          source: grafana
          feature: beta
```

Changes to these configurations **do not require a restart**; they are defined in the [runtime configuration file](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/<LOKI_VERSION>/configure/#runtime-configuration-file).

The available query types are:

- `metric`: a query with an aggregation, e.g. `sum(rate({env="prod"}[1m]))`
- `filter`: a query with a log filter, e.g. `{env="prod"} |= "error"`
- `limited`: a query without a filter or a metric aggregation

The `hash` option uses a [32-bit FNV-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) hash of the query string, represented as a 32-bit unsigned integer.
This can often be easier to use than query strings that are long or require lots of string escaping. A `query_hash` field
is logged with every query request in the `query-frontend` and `querier` logs, for easy reference. Here's an example log line:

```logfmt
level=info ts=2023-03-30T09:08:15.2614555Z caller=metrics.go:152 component=frontend org_id=29 latency=fast 
query="{stream=\"stdout\",pod=\"loki-canary-9w49x\"}" query_hash=2943214005 query_type=limited range_type=range ...
```

The order of patterns is preserved, so the first matching pattern will be used.

## Observing blocked queries

Blocked queries are logged, as well as counted in the `loki_blocked_queries` metric on a per-tenant basis.

When a policy matches by pattern/hash/regex, Loki logs whether the query type and request tags matched that policy:

```logfmt
level=warn msg="query blocker matched with regex policy" user=29 type=metric pattern=".*rate\\(.*\\).*" query="sum(rate({app=\"foo\"}[5m]))" typesMatched=true tagsMatched=false blocked=false
```

If tag constraints fail to match, Loki emits a debug log showing the missing key and the raw header value that was received:

```logfmt
level=debug msg="query blocker tags mismatch: missing or mismatched key" key=feature tagsRaw="Source=grafana,Feature=alpha"
```

## Scope

Queries received via the API and executed as [alerting/recording rules](../../alert/) will be blocked.

## Tag-based blocking

You can scope a blocked query rule to requests that include specific key=value pairs in the `X-Query-Tags` header.

- Header format: `key=value` pairs separated by commas, for example: `Source=grafana,Feature=beta`.
- Allowed characters are alphanumeric plus space, comma, equals, '@', '.', and '-'. Any other characters are replaced with `_`.
- Parsing keeps only canonical `key=value` tokens; malformed tokens are ignored.
- Matching rules:
  - Keys are matched case-insensitively (the server lowercases keys).
  - Values are matched case-insensitively.
  - All specified `tags:` pairs in the rule must be present in the request to apply the block.

Examples:

```yaml
overrides:
  tenant-a:
    blocked_queries:
      # Block only metric queries from a beta feature flag
      - types: metric
        tags:
          feature: beta

      # Combine with regex to narrow scope further
      - pattern: '.*rate\\(.*\\).*'
        regex: true
        tags:
          source: grafana
```
