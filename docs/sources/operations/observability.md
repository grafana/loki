# Observability

Both Grafana Loki and Promtail expose a `/metrics` endpoint that expose Prometheus
metrics (the default port is 3100 for Loki and 80 for Promtail). You will need
a local Prometheus and add Loki and Promtail as targets. See [configuring
Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration)
for more information.

All components of Loki expose the following metrics:

| Metric Name                        | Metric Type | Description                                                                                                                  |

| `loki_log_messages_total`          | Counter     | DEPRECATED. Use internal_log_messages_total for the same functionality. Total number of log messages created by loki itself. |

Most of these metrics are counters and should continuously increase during normal operations:

1. Your app emits a log line to a file that is tracked by Promtail.
2. Promtail reads the new line and increases its counters.
3. Promtail forwards the log line to a Loki distributor, where the received
   counters should increase.
4. The Loki distributor forwards the log line to a Loki ingester, where the
   request duration counter should increase.

If Promtail uses any pipelines with metrics stages, those metrics will also be
exposed by Promtail at its `/metrics` endpoint. See Promtail's documentation on
[Pipelines]({{<relref "../clients/promtail/pipelines">}}) for more information.

An example Grafana dashboard was built by the community and is available as
dashboard [10004](/dashboards/10004).

## Metrics cardinality

Some of the Loki observability metrics are emitted per tracked file (active), with the file path included in labels. 
This increases the quantity of label values across the environment, thereby increasing cardinality. Best practices with Prometheus [labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels) discourage increasing cardinality in this way. 
Review your emitted metrics before scraping with Prometheus, and configure the scraping to avoid this issue.


## Mixins

The Loki repository has a [mixin](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/master/production/loki-mixin) that includes a
set of dashboards, recording rules, and alerts. Together, the mixin gives you a
comprehensive package for monitoring Loki in production.

For more information about mixins, take a look at the docs for the
[monitoring-mixins project](https://github.com/monitoring-mixins/docs).
