weight: 310
---

This guide provides an official, end-to-end reference for deploying a unified log monitoring system using Grafana, Loki, and Grafana Alloy. Centralized log collection is essential for rapid troubleshooting, security auditing, and system performance analysis. By automating both log transfer and ingestion, this setup minimizes operational overhead and ensures that logs from multiple sources arrive in Grafana in near real time.

---

## Step 1: Install Grafana via CLI

Grafana is the visualization layer for metrics and logs. Installing via CLI guarantees reproducible deployments and supports automated provisioning in production environments.  
* For complete installation instructions on all supported platforms, see the official Grafana guide: [Grafana Installation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/)  
* This example uses Ubuntu/Debian; if you’re on another OS, adapt the commands below as needed.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gnupg2 curl
curl https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y grafana
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
````

* Once installed, start Grafana and make sure it's accessible via a port (default: `3000`).
* After Grafana is running, create an admin account. Once logged in, you'll land on the Grafana homepage.

---

## Step 2: Deploy Loki for Log Storage

Loki provides a scalable and cost-effective approach to storing and querying logs alongside your metrics data. Installing Loki next ensures that you have the backend log store ready for ingestion before configuring collection agents.

* For complete installation instructions on all supported platforms, see the official Loki guide: [Loki Installation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/setup/install/)
* This example uses Docker/Docker Compose; if you’re using another approach, adapt the commands below as needed.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  loki:
    image: grafana/loki:latest
    ports:
      - "3100:3100"
    volumes:
      - loki-data:/loki-data
    command: -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml

volumes:
  loki-data:
```

This configuration:

* Exposes Loki’s HTTP API on port **3100**.
* Persists index and chunk data in the named volume **loki-data**.
* Loads default settings from **local-config.yaml**.

Launch with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Step 3: Combine Grafana and Loki via Docker Compose

Co-locating Grafana and Loki in a single Docker Compose file establishes a private network between the services, simplifies configuration, and ensures version compatibility. It also provides a single command to bring up the entire stack.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - loki-net
    volumes:
      - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana

  loki:
    image: grafana/loki:latest
    ports:
      - "3100:3100"
    networks:
      - loki-net
    volumes:
      - loki-data:/loki-data
    command: -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml

networks:
  loki-net:

volumes:
  grafana-data:
  loki-data:
```

* **loki-net** isolates traffic between services.
* **grafana-data** stores dashboards, users, and plugins persistently.

Bring up both services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Step 4: Install and Configure Grafana Alloy

Although Grafana and Loki provide visualization and storage, you need a log collector that reads files, applies labels, and pushes to Loki. Grafana Alloy is the unified log collector that handles file watching, labeling, and direct ingestion into Loki.
* For complete installation instructions on all supported platforms, see the official Alloy guide: [Grafana Alloy Installation](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/set-up/install/)  
*  This example uses the standalone approach; if you’re using another approach, adapt the commands below as needed.

```bash
wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/alloy/alloy-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf alloy-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv alloy /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/alloy
```

Create the Alloy configuration file **alloy-config.yaml**:

```yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080

positions:
  filename: /var/lib/alloy/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: docker_logs
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost"]
        labels:
          job: docker
          __path__: /var/log/docker/*.log

  - job_name: nginx_logs
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost"]
        labels:
          job: nginx
          __path__: /var/log/nginx/*.log

  - job_name: syslog
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost"]
        labels:
          job: syslog
          __path__: /var/log/syslog
```

* **positions.yaml** tracks read offsets to guarantee exactly-once ingestion.
* **clients.url** points to Loki’s push endpoint.
* **scrape\_configs** define which log files to monitor and how they are labeled in Loki.

Start Alloy in the background:

```bash
sudo alloy -config.file=alloy-config.yaml &
```

---

## Step 5: Automate Remote Log Transfer (`transfer_logs.sh`)

In distributed environments, logs are often generated on multiple hosts (application servers, edge devices, etc.). Automating the transfer of those logs to a central location ensures that Alloy can scrape them and that all logs appear in your Grafana dashboards.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

REMOTE="root@REMOTE_IP"
SSH_KEY="~/.ssh/id_rsa"
DEST="/var/log/remote"

mkdir -p "$DEST/docker" "$DEST/nginx" "$DEST/syslog"

echo "Fetching Docker logs..."
ssh -i "$SSH_KEY" "$REMOTE" "cat /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log" > "$DEST/docker/docker.log"

echo "Fetching Nginx logs..."
ssh -i "$SSH_KEY" "$REMOTE" "cat /var/log/nginx/error.log" > "$DEST/nginx/error.log"

echo "Fetching Syslog..."
ssh -i "$SSH_KEY" "$REMOTE" "cat /var/log/syslog" > "$DEST/syslog/syslog.log"

echo "Log transfer complete."
```

* **DEST directories** mirror the local paths defined in Alloy’s config.
* **SSH fetching** ensures secure, on-demand transfer without installing agents on remote hosts.

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x transfer_logs.sh
```

---

## Step 6: Configure Grafana to Use Loki

After you have set up Loki, you must register it in Grafana so that Grafana knows where to query for logs when building dashboards and using Explore.

1. In Grafana’s sidebar, go to the three vertical lines and click **Data Sources → Add data source**.
2. Select **Loki**.
3. Set **URL** to `http://loki:3100` (or `http://localhost:3100`).
4. Click **Save & Test**. A green banner confirms successful connection.

---

## Step 7: Explore Logs in Grafana

Before building dashboards, use Grafana’s **Explore** section to validate that logs are arriving correctly and to experiment with queries. Explore provides an ad-hoc interface to run LogQL queries, filter by labels, and visualize log lines in real time.

* Use label filters such as `{job="docker"}` or `{job="nginx"}`.
* Or even LogQL operators (e.g., `|= "ERROR"`) to refine results.

---

## Step 8: Build a Dedicated Dashboard

Once you've validated queries in Explore, you can save them as panels in a dashboard to provide continuous, at-a-glance monitoring of your log streams. Dashboards allow operators to quickly spot error spikes, trends, and anomalies across different services.

1. Go to the left sidebar, click **Dashboards → New dashboard → Add panel**.
2. Choose **Loki** as the data source.
3. Enter a LogQL query (for example, `{job="syslog"} |= "WARN"`).
4. Select the **Logs** visualization.
5. Repeat for each log stream, adjust panel layouts, and **Save** the dashboard with a descriptive name.

---

## Step 9: Automate Log Retrieval and Update Dashboard

Now, you have your logging dashboard set up. To receive the most up to date logs of your services, we outline an automation process below. Automating the retrieval of new logs and refreshing your Grafana dashboard is crucial for maintaining an up-to-date view without manual CLI steps. To do so, create two minimal Python HTTP servers:

### 9.1: `transfer_server.py`

This script triggers the Alloy process to reload its configuration and pick up new files when accessed via HTTP:

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
import subprocess

COMMAND = "sudo alloy -config.file=alloy-config.yaml"

class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        if self.path == "/reload":
            try:
                subprocess.Popen(COMMAND, shell=True)
                self.send_response(200)
                self.end_headers()
                self.wfile.write(b"Alloy reloaded successfully.")
            except Exception as e:
                self.send_response(500)
                self.end_headers()
                self.wfile.write(f"Error reloading Alloy: {e}".encode())
        else:
            self.send_response(404)
            self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write(b"Not found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_address = ('', 8081)
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandler)
    print("Starting reload server on port 8081. Access /reload to reload Alloy.")
    httpd.serve_forever()
```

### 9.2: `server.py`

This script pulls logs by executing the transfer script when accessed via HTTP:

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
import subprocess

class ScriptHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        if self.path == "/pull":
            try:
                subprocess.run(["/path/to/transfer_logs.sh"], check=True) # for reference, this bash script is outlined in step 5
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header("Content-type", "text/plain")
                self.end_headers()
                self.wfile.write(b"Logs pulled successfully.")
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
                self.send_response(500)
                self.send_header("Content-type", "text/plain")
                self.end_headers()
                self.wfile.write(b"Failed to pull logs.")
        else:
            self.send_response(404)
            self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write(b"Not found.")

def run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=ScriptHandler, port=8080):
    server_address = ('', port)
    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)
    print(f"Starting pull server on port {port}")
    httpd.serve_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

Run both in the background:

```bash
nohup python3 transfer_server.py > transfer_server.log 2>&1 &
nohup python3 server.py > server.log 2>&1 &
```

## Step 10: Add Buttons to Grafana Dashboard

Now, to use these scripts from your dashboard, to enable on demand log updates, add buttons! Embedding one-click buttons in your dashboard is important because it empowers your team to refresh log data and reload the collector without switching to a terminal. To configure:

1. In the dashboard view, click the **gear icon → Links**.

2. Add:

   * **Pull Logs** → `http://<server>:8080/pull`
   * **Reload Collector** → `http://<server>:8081/reload`

3. Save the dashboard. Now, authorized users can trigger both log pulls and Alloy reloads directly from Grafana.
