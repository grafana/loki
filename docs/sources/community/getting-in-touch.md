# Contacting the Loki Team

For questions regarding Loki:

- Ask a question in the `#loki` channel of our [Slack](https://slack.grafana.com/) community
- Open source Loki users are welcome to post technical questions on the Grafana Labs Community Forums under the Grafana Loki category at [community.grafana.com](https://community.grafana.com). Please be mindful that this is a community-driven support channel moderated by Grafana Labs staff where Loki maintainers and community members answer questions when bandwidth allows. Be sure to review the [Community Guidelines](https://community.grafana.com/guidelines) before posting.
- Users deploying Loki via [Grafana Cloud](/products/cloud/) can submit support tickets via the [Grafana.com Account Portal](/login).
- For questions regarding Enterprise support for Loki, you can get in touch with the Grafana Labs team [here](/contact?pg=docs).

Your feedback is always welcome! To submit feedback or a report a potential bug:

- [File a GitHub issue](https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues/new) for bugs, issues and feature suggestions. Grafana UI issues for the Loki data source plugin should be posted directly to the [Grafana repository](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/new), not the Loki repository.
- Send an email to [lokiproject@googlegroups.com](mailto:lokiproject@googlegroups.com), or visit the [google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lokiproject) page.
- Join us for our monthly [Loki Community Call](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MNjiHQxwFukm2J4NJRWyRgRIiK7VpokYyATzJ5ce-O8/edit?usp=sharing) on first Thursday of every month alternating between EU (12:00 UTC) and US (17:00 UTC) timezones. Subscribe to the calendar in the doc for being up to date.
