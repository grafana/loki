1. Update Go version in the Grafana Loki build image (`loki-build-image/Dockerfile`) on the `main` branch.

1. [Release a new Loki Build Image]({{< relref "../release-loki-build-image.md" >}})

1. [Backport]({{< relref "./backport-commits" >}}) the Dockerfile change to `release-VERSION_PREFIX` branch.

1. [Backport]({{< relref "./backport-commits" >}}) the Loki Build Image version change from `main` to `release-VERSION_PREFIX` branch.
