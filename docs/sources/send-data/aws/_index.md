# Sending logs from Amazon Web Services

Sending logs from AWS services to Grafana Loki is a little different depending on the AWS service you are using:

* [Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)]({{< relref "./ec2" >}})
* [Elastic Container Service (ECS)]({{< relref "./ecs" >}})
* [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)]({{< relref "./eks" >}})
