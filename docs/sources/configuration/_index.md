# Configuring Grafana Loki

Grafana Loki is configured in a YAML file (usually referred to as `loki.yaml` )
which contains information on the Loki server and its individual components,
depending on which mode Loki is launched in.

Configuration examples can be found in the [Configuration Examples](examples/) document.

## Printing Loki Config At Runtime

If you pass Loki the flag `-print-config-stderr` or `-log-config-reverse-order`, (or `-print-config-stderr=true`)
Loki will dump the entire config object it has created from the built in defaults combined first with
overrides from config file, and second by overrides from flags.

The result is the value for every config object in the Loki config struct, which is very large...

Many values will not be relevant to your install such as storage configs which you are not using and which you did not define,
this is expected as every option has a default value if it is being used or not.

This config is what Loki will use to run, it can be invaluable for debugging issues related to configuration and
is especially useful in making sure your config files and flags are being read and loaded properly.

`-print-config-stderr` is nice when running Loki directly e.g. `./loki ` as you can get a quick output of the entire Loki config.

`-log-config-reverse-order` is the flag we run Loki with in all our environments, the config entries are reversed so
that the order of configs reads correctly top to bottom when viewed in Grafana's Explore.

## Reload At Runtime

Promtail can reload its configuration at runtime. If the new configuration
is not well-formed, the changes will not be applied.
A configuration reload is triggered by sending a `SIGHUP` to the Promtail process or
sending a HTTP POST request to the `/reload` endpoint (when the `--server.enable-runtime-reload` flag is enabled).

## Configuration File Reference

To specify which configuration file to load, pass the `-config.file` flag at the
command line. The value can be a list of comma separated paths, then the first
file that exists will be used.
If no `-config.file` argument is specified, Loki will look up the `config.yaml` in the
current working directory and the `config/` sub-directory and try to use that.

The file is written in [YAML
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), defined by the scheme below.
Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For non-list parameters the
value is set to the specified default.

### Use environment variables in the configuration

> **Note:** This feature is only available in Loki 2.1+.

You can use environment variable references in the configuration file to set values that need to be configurable during deployment.
To do this, pass `-config.expand-env=true` and use:

```
${VAR}
```

Where VAR is the name of the environment variable.

Each variable reference is replaced at startup by the value of the environment variable.
The replacement is case-sensitive and occurs before the YAML file is parsed.
References to undefined variables are replaced by empty strings unless you specify a default value or custom error text.

To specify a default value, use:

```
${VAR:-default_value}
```

Where default_value is the value to use if the environment variable is undefined.

Pass the `-config.expand-env` flag at the command line to enable this way of setting configs.

### Generic placeholders

- `<boolean>` : a boolean that can take the values `true` or `false`
- `<int>` : any integer matching the regular expression `[1-9]+[0-9]*`
- `<duration>` : a duration matching the regular expression `[0-9]+(ns|us|Âµs|ms|[smh])`
- `<labelname>` : a string matching the regular expression `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`
- `<labelvalue>` : a string of unicode characters
- `<filename>` : a valid path relative to current working directory or an absolute path.
- `<host>` : a valid string consisting of a hostname or IP followed by an optional port number
- `<string>` : a string
- `<secret>` : a string that represents a secret, such as a password

### Supported contents and default values of `loki.yaml`

# The default value "all" runs Loki in single binary mode.
# The value "read" is an alias to run only read-path related components such as

# The value "write" is an alias to run only write-path related components such as
# the distributor and compactor, but all in the same process.
# Supported values: all, compactor, distributor, ingester, querier, query-scheduler,
#  ingester-querier, query-frontend, index-gateway, ruler, table-manager, read, write.

# or be killed due to an out-of-memory error, the crashed querier will be disconnected
# from the query frontend and a new querier will be immediately assigned to the tenantâs shard.
# This invalidates the assumption that shuffle sharding can be used to reduce the
# impact on tenants. This option mitigates the impact by configuring a delay between when

## hedging

The `hedging` block configures how to hedge storage requests.

The hedging implementation sends a second storage request once a first request has
been outstanding for more than a configured expected latency for this class of requests.
Calculate your latency to be the 99th percentile of object storage response times.

```yaml
# An optional duration that sets the quantity of time after a first storage request
# is sent and before a second request is sent, when no response is received for the first
# storage request. The recommended duration is the measured 99th percentile of object
# storage response times, to reduce long tail latency. This option is most impactful
# when used with queriers, and has minimal to no impact on other components.
# The default value of 0 disables the hedging of storage requests.
# Example: "at: 500ms"
[at: <duration> | default = 0]

# An optional maximum quantity of hedged requests to be issued for a given request.

#### auto_scaling_config

The `auto_scaling_config` block configures autoscaling for DynamoDB.

```yaml
# Whether or not autoscaling should be enabled.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.scale.enabled
[enabled: <boolean>: default = false]

# AWS AutoScaling role ARN.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.scale.role-arn
[role_arn: <string>]

[in_cooldown: <int> | default = 1800]

# DynamoDB target ratio of consumed capacity to provisioned capacity.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.scale.target-value
[target: <float> | default = 80]
```

## tracing

The `tracing` block configures tracing for Jaeger. Currently limited to disable auto-configuration per [environment variables](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.16/client-features/) only.

```yaml
# Whether or not tracing should be enabled.
# CLI flag: -tracing.enabled
[enabled: <boolean>: default = true]
```

## common

The `common` block sets common definitions to be shared by different components.
This way, one doesn't have to replicate configuration in multiple places.

```yaml
# A common storage configuration to be used by the different Loki components.
[storage: <storage>]

# When defined, the given prefix will be present in front of the endpoint paths.
[path_prefix: <string>]

# How many times incoming data should be replicated to the ingester component.
[replication_factor: <int> | default = 3]

# When true, the ingester, compactor, and query_scheduler ring tokens will be saved
# to files in the path_prefix directory. Loki will error if you set this to true
# and path_prefix is empty.
[persist_tokens: <boolean>: default = false]

# A common list of net interfaces used internally to look for addresses.
# If a more specific "instance_interface_names" is set, this is ignored.
# If "instance_interface_names" under the common ring section is configured,
# this common "instance_interface_names" is only applied to the frontend, but not for
# ring related components (ex: distributor, ruler, etc).
[instance_interface_names: <list of string> | default = [<private network interfaces>]]

# A common address used by Loki components to advertise their address.
# If a more specific "instance_addr" is set, this is ignored.
# If "instance_addr" under the common ring section is configured, this common "instance_addr"
# is only applied to the frontend, but not for ring related components (ex: distributor, ruler, etc).
[instance_addr: <string>]

# A common ring configuration to be used by all Loki rings.
# If a common ring is given, its values are used to define any undefined ring values.
# For instance, you can expect the `heartbeat_period` defined in the common section
# to be used by the distributor's ring, but only if the distributor's ring itself
# doesn't have a `heartbeat_period` set.
[ring: <ring>]

# Address and port number where the compactor API is served.
# CLI flag: -common.compactor-address
[compactor_address: <string> | default = ""]

# Address and port number where the compactor grpc requests are being served.
# CLI flag: -common.compactor-grpc-address
[compactor_grpc_address: <string> | default = ""]

## analytics

The `analytics` block configures the reporting of Loki analytics to grafana.com.

```yaml
# By default, Loki will send anonymous, but uniquely-identifiable usage and configuration
# analytics to Grafana Labs. These statistics are sent to https://stats.grafana.org/
#
# Statistics help us better understand how Loki is used, and they show us performance
# levels for most users. This helps us prioritize features and documentation.
# For more information on what's sent, look at
# https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/pkg/usagestats/stats.go
# Refer to the buildReport method to see what goes into a report.
#
# When true, enables usage reporting.
# CLI flag: -reporting.enabled
[reporting_enabled: <boolean>: default = true]
```

### storage

The common `storage` block defines a common storage to be reused by different
components as a way to facilitate storage configuration.
If any specific configuration for an object storage client have been provided elsewhere in the configuration file, the specific configuration will supersede the common storage configuration.

```yaml
# Configures Azure as the common storage.
[azure: <azure_storage_config>]

# Configures GCS as the common storage.
[gcs: <gcs_storage_config>]

# Configures S3 as the common storage.
[s3: <s3_storage_config>]

# Configures Swift as the common storage.
[swift: <swift_storage_config>]

# Configures a (local) file system as the common storage.
[filesystem: <filesystem>]

# Configures Baidu Object Storage (BOS) as the common storage.
[bos: <bos_storage_config>]

# The `hedging_config` configures how to hedge requests for the storage.
[hedging: <hedging_config>]

```

### filesystem

The common `filesystem` block configures a local file system as a general
storage for various types of data generated by Loki.

```yaml
# File system directory to be used for chunks storage.
[chunks_directory: <filename> | default = ""]

# File system directory to be used for rules storage.
[rules_directory: <filename> | default = ""]
```

### ring

The common `ring` block defines a ring configuration used by a Loki component.

```yaml
# The key-value store used to share the hash ring across multiple instances.
kvstore:
  # Backend storage to use for the ring. Supported values are: consul, etcd,
  # inmemory, memberlist, multi.
  # CLI flag: -<prefix>.store
  [store: <string> | default = "memberlist"]

  # The prefix for the keys in the store. Should end with a /.
  # CLI flag: -<prefix>.prefix
  [prefix: <string> | default = "collectors/"]

  # The consul_config configures the consul client.
  [consul: <consul_config>]

  # The etcd_config configures the etcd client.
  [etcd: <etcd_config>]

  multi:
    # Primary backend storage used by multi-client.
    # CLI flag: -<prefix>.multi.primary
    [primary: <string> | default = ""]

    # Secondary backend storage used by multi-client.
    # CLI flag: -<prefix>.multi.secondary
    [secondary: <string> | default = ""]

    # Mirror writes to secondary store.
    # CLI flag: -<prefix>.multi.mirror-enabled
    [mirror_enabled: <boolean> | default = false]

    # Timeout for storing value to secondary store.
    # CLI flag: -<prefix>.multi.mirror-timeout
    [mirror_timeout: <duration> | default = 2s]

# Interval between heartbeats sent to the ring. 0 = disabled.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.heartbeat-period
[heartbeat_period: <duration> | default = 15s]

# The heartbeat timeout after which store gateways are considered unhealthy
# within the ring. 0 = never (timeout disabled). This option needs be set both
# on the store-gateway and querier when running in microservices mode.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.heartbeat-timeout
[heartbeat_timeout: <duration> | default = 1m]

# File path where tokens are stored. If empty, tokens are neither stored at
# shutdown nor restored at startup.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.tokens-file-path
[tokens_file_path: <string> | default = ""]

# True to enable zone-awareness and replicate blocks across different
# availability zones.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.zone-awareness-enabled
[zone_awareness_enabled: <boolean> | default = false]

# Name of network interface to read addresses from.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.instance-interface-names
[instance_interface_names: <list of string> | default = [<private network interfaces>]]

# IP address to advertise in the ring.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.instance-addr
[instance_addr: <list of string> | default = first from instance_interface_names]

# Port to advertise in the ring
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.instance-port
[instance_port: <list of string> | default = server.grpc-listen-port]

# Instance ID to register in the ring.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.instance-id
[instance_id: <list of string> | default = os.Hostname()]

# The availability zone where this instance is running. Required if
# zone-awareness is enabled.
# CLI flag: -<prefix>.instance-availability-zone
[instance_availability_zone: <string> | default = ""]
```

## Runtime Configuration file

Loki has a concept of "runtime config" file, which is simply a file that is reloaded while Loki is running. It is used by some Loki components to allow operator to change some aspects of Loki configuration without restarting it. File is specified by using `-runtime-config.file=<filename>` flag and reload period (which defaults to 10 seconds) can be changed by `-runtime-config.reload-period=<duration>` flag. Previously this mechanism was only used by limits overrides, and flags were called `-limits.per-user-override-config=<filename>` and `-limits.per-user-override-period=10s` respectively. These are still used, if `-runtime-config.file=<filename>` is not specified.

At the moment, two components use runtime configuration: limits and multi KV store.

Options for runtime configuration reload can also be configured via YAML:

```yaml
# Configuration file to periodically check and reload.
[file: <string>: default = empty]

# How often to check the file.
[period: <duration>: default 10s]
```

Example runtime configuration file:

```yaml
overrides:
  tenant1:
    ingestion_rate_mb: 10
    max_streams_per_user: 100000
    max_chunks_per_query: 100000
  tenant2:
    max_streams_per_user: 1000000
    max_chunks_per_query: 1000000

multi_kv_config:
    mirror-enabled: false
    primary: consul
```

## Accept out-of-order writes

Since the beginning of Loki, log entries had to be written to Loki in order
by time.
This limitation has been lifted.
Out-of-order writes are enabled globally by default, but can be disabled/enabled
on a cluster or per-tenant basis.

- To disable out-of-order writes for all tenants,
place in the `limits_config` section:

    ```
    limits_config:
        unordered_writes: false
    ```

- To disable out-of-order writes for specific tenants,
configure a runtime configuration file:

    ```
    runtime_config: overrides.yaml
    ```

    In the `overrides.yaml` file, add `unordered_writes` for each tenant
    permitted to have out-of-order writes:

    ```
    overrides:
      "tenantA":
        unordered_writes: false
    ```

How far into the past accepted out-of-order log entries may be
is configurable with `max_chunk_age`.
`max_chunk_age` defaults to 2 hour.
Loki calculates the earliest time that out-of-order entries may have
and be accepted with

```
time_of_most_recent_line - (max_chunk_age/2)
```

Log entries with timestamps that are after this earliest time are accepted.
Log entries further back in time return an out-of-order error.

For example, if `max_chunk_age` is 2 hours
and the stream `{foo="bar"}` has one entry at `8:00`,
Loki will accept data for that stream as far back in time as `7:00`.
If another log line is written at `10:00`,
Loki will accept data for that stream as far back in time as `9:00`.
