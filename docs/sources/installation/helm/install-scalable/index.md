# Install the Helm Chart
<!-- vale Grafana.Quotes = NO -->
<!-- vale Grafana.Quotes = YES -->

This Helm Chart installation runs the Grafana Loki cluster within a Kubernetes cluster.

If object storge is configured, this chart configures Loki to run `read` and `write` targets in a [scalable mode]({{<relref "../../../fundamentals/architecture/deployment-modes/#simple-scalable-deployment-mode">}}), highly available architecture (3 replicas of each) designed to work with AWS S3 object storage. It will also configure meta-monitoring of metrics and logs.

It is not possible to run the scalable mode with the `filesystem` storage.

**Before you begin:**

- Helm 3 or above. See [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
- A running Kubernetes cluster.
- A Prometheus operator installation in case meta-monitoring should be used.
- Optionally a Memcached deployment for better performance. Consult the [caching section]({{<relref "../../../operations/caching">}}) on how to configure Memcached.

**To deploy Loki in scalable mode:**

1. Add [Grafana's chart repository](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts) to Helm:

    ```bash
    helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
    ```

1. Update the chart repository:

    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```

1. Configure the object storage:

    - Create the configuration file `values.yaml`. The example below illustrates a s3 configuration:

      ```yaml
      loki:
        storage:
          bucketNames:
            chunks: chunks
            ruler: ruler
            admin: admin
          type: s3
          s3:
            endpoint: <endpoint>
            region: <AWS region>
            secretAccessKey: <AWS secret access key>
            accessKeyId: <AWS access key ID>
            s3ForcePathStyle: false
            insecure: false
      ```

      Consult the [Reference]({{<relref "../reference">}}) for configuring other storage providers.

    - If you're just trying things, you can use the following configuration instead, that sets MinIO as storage:
      ```yaml
      minio:
        enabled: true
      ```

1. Install or upgrade the Loki deployment with this command.

   ```bash
   helm install --values values.yaml loki grafana/loki
   # or upgrade for existing installations
   helm upgrade --values values.yaml loki grafana/loki
   ```
