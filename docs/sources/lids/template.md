## Background

_Describe the key facts and link to any documents, architecture diagrams or code. Keep this short, just a paragraph or two._

## Problem Statement

_Describe why the above is a problem we have now or will have in the future. Just a paragraph or two._

## Goals

_Describe the goals that we wish to achieve when considering the options available. Be clear about what is important and what could be left to the future. Non-goals are also useful to list here to clarify intent._

## Non-Goals (optional)

_What is out of scope for this proposal? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion and make progress. Highlight anything that is being deferred to a later phase of implementation that may call for its own enhancement._

## Proposals

_List at least two possible ways of achieving the goals, these are typically different technical approaches that have differing trade-offs so summarise the trade-offs. “Do nothing” is typically worth considering too._

### Proposal 0: Do nothing

_Describe what happens if we do nothing, how bad does the problem become (over what time frame)?_

### Proposal 1: Title

_Describe the first proposal, what are the benefits and trade-offs that this approach has?_

### Proposal n: Title

_Describe the nth proposal(s), what are the benefits and trade-offs that these approaches have?_

## Other Notes
