title: multiline

# `multiline` stage

The `multiline` stage merges multiple lines into a multiline block before passing it on to the next stage in the pipeline.

A new block is identified by the `firstline` regular expression. Any line that does *not* match the expression is considered to be part of the block of the previous match.

## Schema

```yaml
multiline:
  # RE2 regular expression, if matched will start a new multiline block.
  # This expresion must be provided.
  firstline: <string>

  # The maximum wait time will be parsed as a Go duration: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration.
  # If now new logs arrive withing this maximum wait time the current block will be sent on.
  # This is useful if the opserved application dies with e.g. an exception. No new logs will arrive and the exception
  # block is sent *after* the maximum wait time expired.
  # It defaults to 3s.
  max_wait_time: <duration>

  # Maximum number of lines a block can have. If block has more lines a new block is started.
  # The default is 128 lines.
  max_lines: <integer>
```

## Examples

Let's say we have the following logs from a very simple [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) service.

```
[2020-12-03 11:36:20] "GET /hello HTTP/1.1" 200 -

```

We would like to collapse all lines of the traceback into one multiline block. In this example, all blocks start with a timestamp in brackets. Thus we configure a `multiline` stage with the `firstline` regular expression `^\[\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{1,2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\]`. This will match the start of the traceback but not the following lines until `Exception: Sorry, this route always breaks`. These will be part of a multiline block and one log entry in Loki.

```yaml
multiline:
  # Identify timestamps as first line of a multiline block.
  firstline: "^\[\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{1,2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\]"

  max_wait_time: 3s
```
