Sending logs from AWS services to Grafana Loki is a little different depending on what AWS service you are using:

* [Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)]({{<relref "./ec2/_index.md">}})
* [Elastic Container Service (ECS)]({{<relref "./ecs/_index.md">}})
* [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)]({{<relref "./eks/_index.md">}})
