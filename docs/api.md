# Loki API

## Authentication

*nb* Authentication is out of scope for this project.
You are expected to run an authenticating reverse proxy in front of our services, such as an Nginx with basic auth or an OAuth2 proxy.

Loki is a multitenant system; requests and data for tenant A are isolated from tenant B.
Requests to the Loki API should include an HTTP header (`X-Scope-OrgID`) identifying the tenant for the request.
Tenant IDs can be any alphanumeric string; limiting them to 20 bytes is reasonable.

Loki can be run in "single-tenant" mode where the `X-Scope-OrgID` header is not required.
In this situation, the tenant ID is defaulted to be `fake`.

## REST API

There are 4 API endpoints:

- `POST /api/prom/push`

  For sending log entries, expects a snappy compressed proto in the HTTP Body:

  - [ProtoBuffer definition](/pkg/logproto/logproto.proto)
  - [Golang client library](/pkg/promtail/client.go)

  Also accepts JSON formatted requests when the header `Content-Type: application/json` is sent.  Example of the JSON format:

  ```json
  {
      "streams": [
          {
              "labels": "{foo=\"bar\"}",
              "entries": [
                  {"ts": "2018-12-18T08:28:06.801064-04:00", "line": "baz"}
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/prom/query`

  For doing queries, accepts the following parameters in the query-string:
  - `query`: a logQL query
  - `limit`: max number of entries to return
  - `start`: the start time for the query, as a nanosecond Unix epoch (nanoseconds since 1970)
  - `end`: the end time for the query, as a nanosecond Unix epoch (nanoseconds since 1970)
  - `direction`: `forward` or `backward`, useful when specifying a limit
  - `regexp`: a regex to filter the returned results, will eventually be rolled into the query language

  Responses looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "streams": [
      {
        "labels": "{instance=\"...\", job=\"...\", namespace=\"...\"}",
        "entries": [
          {
            "timestamp": "2018-06-27T05:20:28.699492635Z",
            "line": "..."
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/prom/label`

  For retrieving the names of the labels one can query on.

  Responses looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "values": [
      "instance",
      "job",
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/prom/label/<name>/values`
  For retrieving the label values one can query on.

  Responses looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "values": [
      "default",
      "cortex-ops",
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
