# Installing Loki Locally

## Release Binaries

Every release includes binaries for Loki which can be found on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases).


## Community openSUSE Linux packages

The community provides packages of Loki for openSUSE Linux. To install:

1. Add the repository `https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/logging/`
   to your system. For example, if you are using Leap 15.1, run
   `sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/logging/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/security:logging.repo ; sudo zypper ref`
2. Install the Loki package with `zypper in loki`
3. Enable the Loki and Promtail services:
  - `systemd start loki && systemd enable loki`
  - `systemd start promtail && systemd enable promtail`
4. Modify the configuration files as needed: `/etc/loki/promtail.yaml` and
   `/etc/loki/loki.yaml`.
