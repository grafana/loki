# Install and run Loki locally

In order to log events with Loki, you must download and install both Promtail and Loki.
- Loki is the logging engine.
- Promtail sends logs to Loki.

## Install and run

1. Navigate to the [release page](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/).
2. Scroll down to the Assets section under the version that you want to install.
3. Download the Loki and Promtail .zip files that correspond to your system.
   **Note:** Do not download LogCLI or Loki Canary at this time. [LogCLI](../getting-started/logcli.md) allows you to run Loki queries in a command line interface. [Loki Canary](../operations/loki-canary.md) is a tool to audit Loki performance.
4. Unzip the package contents into the same directory. This is where the two programs will run.
5. In the command line, change directory (`cd` on most systems) to the directory with Loki and Promtail. Copy and paste the commands below into your command line to download generic configuration files:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/loki/master/cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/loki/master/cmd/promtail/promtail-local-config.yaml
```
6. Enter the following command to start Loki:

**Windows**

```
.\loki-windows-amd64.exe --config.file=loki-local-config.yaml
```

**Linux**
```
./loki-linux-amd64 -config.file=loki-local-config.yaml
```

Loki runs and displays Loki logs in your command line and on http://localhost:3100/metrics.

Congratulations, Loki is installed and running! Next, you might want edit the Promtail config file to [get logs into Loki](../getting-started/get-logs-into-loki.md).

## Release binaries - openSUSE Linux only
