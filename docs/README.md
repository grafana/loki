  <small>Like Prometheus, but for logs!</small> </p>

Grafana Loki is a set of components that can be composed into a fully featured
logging stack.

Unlike other logging systems, Loki is built around the idea of only indexing
metadata about your logs: labels (just like Prometheus labels). Log data itself
is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores such as S3 or GCS, or
even locally on the filesystem. A small index and highly compressed chunks
simplifies the operation and significantly lowers the cost of Loki.
