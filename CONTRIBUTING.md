# Contribute

Loki uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests:

- If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request.
- If you plan to do something more involved, discuss your ideas on the relevant GitHub issue.

## Steps to contribute

For now, you need to add your fork as a remote on the original **\$GOPATH**/src/github.com/grafana/loki clone, so:

```bash

$ go get github.com/grafana/loki
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/grafana/loki # GOPATH is $HOME/go by default.

$ git remote add <FORK_NAME> <FORK_URL>
```

Notice: `go get` return `package github.com/grafana/loki: no Go files in /go/src/github.com/grafana/loki` is normal.
