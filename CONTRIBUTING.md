# Contribute

Loki uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests:

- If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request.
- If you plan to do something more involved, discuss your ideas on the relevant GitHub issue.
- Make sure to follow the prerequisites below before marking your PR as ready for review.

## Pull Request Prerequisites/Checklist

1. Your PR title is in the form `<Feature Area>: Your change`.
  a. It does not end the title with punctuation. It will be added in the changelog.
  b. It starts with an imperative verb. Example: Fix the latency between System A and System B.
  c. It uses Sentence case, not Title Case.
  d. It uses a complete phrase or sentence. The PR title will appear in a changelog, so help other people understand what your change will be.
  e. It has a clear description saying what it does and why. Your PR description will be present in the project' commit log, so be gentle to it.
2. Your PR is well sync'ed with main
3. Your PR is correctly documenting appropriate changes under the CHANGELOG. You should document your changes there if:
  * It adds an important feature
  * It fixes an issue present in a previous release
  * It causes a change in operation that would be useful for an operator of Loki to know
You can skip this step for documentation changes, build related changes and simple bug fixes or enhancements. Rationale being we are attempting to curate the CHANGELOG entries with most relevant and important changes that end users of Loki care about.
4. Your PR documents upgrading steps under `docs/sources/upgrading/_index.md` if it changes:
  * Default configuration values
  * Metric names or label names
  * Changes existing log lines that may be used in dashboard or alerts. e.g: logs lines in any `metrics.go` files might be getting used in building dashboards or alerts.
  * Configuration parameters
  * Any breaking changes to HTTP or gRPC API endpoints
  * Any other change that would require special attention or extra steps to upgrade
Please document clearly what changed AND what needs to be done in the upgrade guide.

## Contribute to helm

Please follow the [Loki Helm Chart](./production/helm/loki/README.md).

### Dependency management

We use [Go modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) to manage dependencies on external packages.
This requires a working Go environment with version 1.15 or greater and git installed.

To add or update a new dependency, use the `go get` command:

```bash
# Pick the latest tagged release.
go get example.com/some/module/pkg

# Pick a specific version.
go get example.com/some/module/pkg@vX.Y.Z
```

Tidy up the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files:

```bash
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
git add go.mod go.sum vendor
git commit
```

You have to commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum` before submitting the pull request.

## Coding Standards

### go imports
imports should follow `std libs`, `externals libs` and `local packages` format

Example
```
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"

	"github.com/prometheus/common/model"
	"github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pkg/labels"

	"github.com/grafana/loki/pkg/logproto"
	"github.com/grafana/loki/pkg/logql"
)
```
