# Copy the config.yml file we created in the step above, inside the container itself. This simplifies the 
# configuration of the Promtail instance.
COPY config.yml /etc/promtail/config.yml

# file with environment variables (this is to avoid hardcoding values such as API Keys), and lastly, to print
# the whole configuration file to STDERR when starting the container (this is helpful for debugging).
