# Loki Canary Test

Loki canary test is a tool to verify that a loki canary is running correctly, and as a result, a good way to test that a Loki cluster with a canary deployed is also running correctly. It's primary use is for testing the helm chart after installation, but can be used standalone to test any Loki Canary / Cluster.
