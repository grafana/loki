# Loki Docker Logging Driver

## Overview

Docker logging driver plugins extends Docker's logging capabilities. You can use Loki Docker logging driver plugin to send
Docker container logs directly to your Loki instance or [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/loki).

> Docker plugins are not yet supported on Windows; see Docker's logging driver plugin [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/)

If you have any questions or issues using the Docker plugin feel free to open an issue in this [repository](https://github.com/grafana/loki/issues).

## Plugin Installation

You need to install the plugin on each Docker host with container from which you want to collect logs.

You can install the plugin from our Docker hub repository by running on the Docker host the following command:

```bash
docker plugin install  grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest --alias loki --grant-all-permissions
```

To check the status of installed plugins, use the `docker plugin ls` command. Plugins that start successfully are listed as enabled in the output:

```bash
docker plugin ls
ID                  NAME         DESCRIPTION           ENABLED
ac720b8fcfdb        loki         Loki Logging Driver   true
```

You can now configure the plugin.

## Plugin Configuration

The Docker daemon on each Docker host has a default logging driver; each container on the Docker host uses the default driver, unless you configure it to use a different logging driver.

### Configure the logging driver for a container

When you start a container, you can configure it to use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon’s default, using the `--log-driver` flag. If the logging driver has configurable options, you can set them using one or more instances of the `--log-opt <NAME>=<VALUE>` flag. Even if the container uses the default logging driver, it can use different configurable options.

The following command configure the container `grafana` to start with the loki drivers which will send logs to `logs-us-west1.grafana.net` Loki instance, using a batch size of 400 entries and will retry maximum 5 times if it fails.

```bash
docker run --log-driver=loki \
    --log-opt loki-url="https://<user_id>:<password>@logs-us-west1.grafana.net/api/prom/push" \
    --log-opt loki-retries=5 \
    --log-opt loki-batch-size=400 \
    grafana/grafana
```

### Configure the default logging driver

To configure the Docker daemon to default to Loki logging driver, set the value of `log-driver` to `loki` logging driver in the `daemon.json` file, which is located in `/etc/docker/`. The following example explicitly sets the default logging driver to Loki:

```json
{
    "debug" : true,
    "log-driver": "loki"
}
```

The logging driver has configurable options, you can set them in the `daemon.json` file as a JSON array with the key log-opts. The following example sets the Loki push endpoint and batch size of the logging driver:

```json
{
    "debug" : true,
    "log-driver": "loki",
    "log-opts": {
        "loki-url": "https://<user_id>:<password>@logs-us-west1.grafana.net/api/prom/push",
        "loki-batch-size": "400"
    }
}
```

> **Note**: log-opt configuration options in the daemon.json configuration file must be provided as strings. Boolean and numeric values (such as the value for loki-batch-size in the example above) must therefore be enclosed in quotes (").

Restart the Docker daemon and it will be configured with Loki logging driver, all containers from that host will send logs to Loki instance.

### Configure the logging driver for a Swarm service or Compose

You can also configure the logging driver for a [swarm service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/) directly in your compose file, this also work for a docker-compose deployment:

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  logger:
    image: grafana/grafana
    logging:
      driver: loki
      options:
        loki-url: "https://<user_id>:<password>@logs-us-west1.grafana.net/api/prom/push"
```

You can then deploy your stack using:

```bash
docker stack deploy my_stack_name --compose-file docker-compose.yaml
```

Once deployed the Grafana service will be sending logs automatically to Loki.

> **Note**: stack name and service name are automatically discovered and sent as Loki labels for each swarm service, this way you can filter by them in Grafana.

## Labels

Loki can received a set of labels along with log line. These labels are used to index log entries and query back logs using [LogQL stream selector](../../docs/usage.md#log-stream-selector).

By default the Docker driver will add the `filename` where the log is written, the `host` where the log has been generated as well as the `container_name`. Additionally `swarm_stack` and `swarm_service` are added for Docker Swarm deployments.

You can add more labels by using `loki-external-labels`,`loki-pipeline-stage-file`,`labels`,`env` and `env-regex` options as described below.

## log-opt options

To specify additional logging driver options, you can use the --log-opt NAME=VALUE flag.

| Option                    | Required? | Default Value        | Description
| ------------------------- | :-------: | :------------------: | -------------------------------------- |

| `loki-external-labels`      | No        | `container_name={{.Name}}` | Additional label value pair separated by `,` to send with logs.

| `loki-timeout`          | No        | `10s`     | The timeout to use when sending logs to the Loki instance. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
| `loki-batch-wait`          | No        | `1s`            | The amount of time to wait before sending a log batch complete or not. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
| `loki-batch-size`             | No        | `102400`               | The maximum size of a log batch to send.
| `loki-min-backoff`       | No        | `100ms`                 | The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a batch. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
| `loki-max-backoff`       | No        | `10s`                 | The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a batch. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
| `loki-retries`           | No        | `10`            | The maximum amount of retries for a log batch.
| `loki-pipeline-stage-file`     | No        |                  | The location of a pipeline stage configuration file ([example](./pipeline-example.yaml)). Pipeline stages allows to parse log lines to extract more labels. [see documentation](../../docs/logentry/processing-log-lines.md)
| `loki-tls-ca-file`            | No        |                      | Set the path to a custom certificate authority.
| `loki-tls-cert-file` | No        |               | Set the path to a client certificate file.
| `loki-tls-key-file`         | No        |                      | Set the path to a client key.
| `loki-tls-server-name`          | No        |                      | Name used to validate the server certificate.
| `loki-tls-insecure-skip-verify`           | No        | `false`                | Allow to skip tls verification.
| `loki-proxy-url`                       | No        |           | Proxy URL use to connect to Loki.
| `labels`                   | No | | Comma-separated list of keys of labels, which should be included in message, if these labels are specified for container.
| `env`                   | No | | Comma-separated list of keys of environment variables to be included in message if they specified for a container.
| `env-regex`                   | No | | A regular expression to match logging-related environment variables. Used for advanced log label options. If there is collision between the label and env keys, the value of the env takes precedence. Both options add additional fields to the labels of a logging message.

## Uninstall the plugin

To cleanly disable and remove the plugin, run:

```bash
docker plugin disable loki
docker plugin rm loki
```

## Upgrade the plugin

To upgrade the plugin to the last version, run:

```bash
docker plugin disable loki
docker plugin upgrade loki grafana/loki-docker-driver:master
docker plugin enable loki
```

## Troubleshooting

Plugin logs can be found as docker daemon log. To enable debug mode, export environment variable LOGGIN_LEVEL=DEBUG in docker engine environment. See the Docker documentation for information about how to enable debug mode in your docker environment: https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/

Stdout of a plugin is redirected to Docker logs. Such entries have a plugin= suffix.

To find out the plugin ID of Loki, use the command below and look for Loki plugin entry.

```bash
docker plugin ls
```

Depending on your system, location of Docker daemon logging may vary. Refer to Docker documentation for Docker daemon log location for your specific platform. ([see](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/))
