# Fluent Bit output plugin

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) is a Fast and Lightweight Data Forwarder, it can be configured with the [Loki output plugin](https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.12/output/) to ship logs to Loki. You can define which log files you want to collect using the [`Tail`](https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.12/input/tail.html) or [`Stdin`](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/standard-input) [input plugin](https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.12/getting_started/input.html). Additionally Fluent Bit supports multiple `Filter` and `Parser` plugins (`Kubernetes`, `JSON`, etc..) to structure and alter log lines.

This plugin is implemented with [Fluent Bit's Go plugin](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-go) interface. It pushes logs to Loki using a GRPC connection.

> syslog and systemd input plugin have not been tested yet, feedback appreciated.

## Configuration Options

| Key           | Description                                   | Default                             |
| --------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Url           | Url of loki server API endpoint.               | http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push |
| TenantID      | The tenant ID used by default to push logs to Loki. If omitted or empty it assumes Loki is running in single-tenant mode and no `X-Scope-OrgID` header is sent.               | "" |
| BatchWait     | Time to wait before send a log batch to Loki, full or not. | 1s   |
| BatchSize     | Log batch size to send a log batch to Loki (unit: Bytes).    | 10 KiB (10 * 1024 Bytes) |
| Timeout     | Maximum time to wait for loki server to respond to a request.   | 10s |
| MinBackoff     | Initial backoff time between retries.   | 500ms |
| MaxBackoff     | Maximum backoff time between retries.   | 5m |
| MaxRetries     | Maximum number of retries when sending batches.   | 10 |
| Labels        | labels for API requests.                       | {job="fluent-bit"}                    |
| LogLevel      | LogLevel for plugin logger.                    | "info"                              |

| LineFormat    | Format to use when flattening the record to a log line. Valid values are "json" or "key_value". If set to "json" the log line sent to Loki will be the fluentd record (excluding any keys extracted out as labels) dumped as json. If set to "key_value", the log line will be each item in the record concatenated together (separated by a single space) in the format <key>=<value>. | json |
| DropSingleKey | If set to true and after extracting label_keys a record only has a single key remaining, the log line sent to Loki will just be the value of the record key.| true |

| DqueSync| Whether to fsync each queue change | false
| DqueName | Queue name, must be uniq per output | dque

### Labels

Labels are used to [query logs](../../docs/logql.md) `{container_name="nginx", cluster="us-west1"}`, they are usually metadata about the workload producing the log stream (`instance`, `container_name`, `region`, `cluster`, `level`).  In Loki labels are indexed consequently you should be cautious when choosing them (high cardinality label values can have performance drastic impact).

You can use `Labels`, `RemoveKeys` , `LabelKeys` and `LabelMapPath` to how the output plugin will perform labels extraction.

### AutoKubernetesLabels

If set to true, it will add all Kubernetes labels to Loki labels automatically and ignore parameters `LabelKeys`, LabelMapPath.

### LabelMapPath

When using the `Parser` and `Filter` plugins Fluent Bit can extract and add data to the current record/log data. While Loki labels are key value pair, record data can be nested structures.
You can pass a json file that defines how to extract [labels](../../docs/overview/README.md#overview-of-loki) from each record. Each json key from the file will be matched with the log record to find label values. Values from the configuration are used as label names.

Considering the record below :

```json
{
  "kubernetes": {
    "container_name": "promtail",
    "pod_name": "promtail-xxx",
    "namespace_name": "prod",
    "labels" : {
        "team": "x-men",
    },
  },
  "HOSTNAME": "docker-desktop",
  "log" : "a log line",
  "time": "20190926T152206Z",
}
```

and a LabelMap file as follow :

```json
{
  "kubernetes": {
    "container_name": "container",
    "pod_name": "pod",
    "namespace_name": "namespace",
    "labels" : {
        "team": "team",
    },
  },
}
```

The labels extracted will be `{team="x-men", container="promtail", pod="promtail-xxx", namespace="prod"}`.

If you don't want the `kubernetes` and `HOSTNAME` fields to appear in the log line you can use the `RemoveKeys` configuration field. (e.g. `RemoveKeys kubernetes,HOSTNAME`).

### Buffering
Buffering refers to the ability to store the records somewhere, and while they are processed and delivered, still be able to store more. Loki output plugin in certain situation can be blocked by loki client because of its design:
* BatchSize is over limit, output plugin pause receiving new records until the pending batch is sucessfully sent to the server
* Loki server is unreachable (retry 429s, 500s and connection-level errors), output plugin blocks new records until loki server will be avalible again and the pending batch is sucessfully sent to the server or as long as the maximum number of attempts has been reached within configured backoff mechanism

The blocking state with some of the input plugins is not acceptable because it can have a undesirable side effects on the part that generates the logs. Fluent Bit implements buffering mechanism that is based on parallel processing and it cannot send logs in order which is loki requirement (loki logs must be in increasing time order per stream).

Loki output plugin has buffering mechanism based on [`dque`](https://github.com/joncrlsn/dque) which is compatible with loki server strict time ordering and can be set up by configuration flag:
```properties
[Output]
    Name loki
    Match *
    Url http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push
    Buffer true
    DqueSegmentSize 8096
    DqueDir /tmp/flb-storage/buffer
    DqueName loki.0
```


### Configuration examples

To configure the Loki output plugin add this section to fluent-bit.conf

```properties
[Output]
    Name loki
    Match *
    Url http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push
    BatchWait 1s
    BatchSize 30720
    # (30KiB)
    Labels {test="fluent-bit-go", lang="Golang"}
    RemoveKeys key1,key2
    LabelKeys key3,key4
    LineFormat key_value
```

```properties
[Output]
    Name loki
    Match *
    Url http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push
    BatchWait 1s
    BatchSize 30720 # (30KiB)
    AutoKubernetesLabels true
    RemoveKeys key1,key2
```
A full [example configuration file](fluent-bit.conf) is also available in this repository.

### Running multiple plugin instances

You can run multiple plugin instances in the same fluent-bit process, for example if you want to push to different Loki servers or route logs into different Loki tenant IDs. To do so, add additional `[Output]` sections.

## Building

## Prerequisites

* Go 1.11+
* gcc (for cgo)

```bash
make fluent-bit-plugin
```

## Usage

## Local

If you have Fluent Bit installed in your `$PATH` you can run the plugin using:

```bash
fluent-bit -e /path/to/built/out_loki.so -c fluent-bit.conf
```

You can also adapt your plugins.conf, removing the need to change the command line options:

```
[PLUGINS]
    Path /path/to/built/out_loki.so
```

## Docker

You can run a Fluent Bit container with Loki output plugin pre-installed using our [docker hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/grafana/repository/docker/grafana/fluent-bit-plugin-loki) image:

```bash
docker run -v /var/log:/var/log \
    -e LOG_PATH="/var/log/*.log" -e LOKI_URL="http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push" \
    grafana/fluent-bit-plugin-loki:latest
```

## Kubernetes

You can run Fluent Bit as a [Daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) to collect all your Kubernetes workload logs.

To do so you can use our [Fluent Bit helm chart](../../production/helm/fluent-bit/README.md):

> Make sure [tiller](https://helm.sh/docs/install/) is installed correctly in your cluster

```bash
helm repo add loki https://grafana.github.io/loki/charts
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install fluent-bit loki/fluent-bit \
    --set loki.serviceName=loki.svc.cluster.local
```

By default it will collect all containers logs and extract labels from Kubernetes API (`container_name`, `namespace`, etc..).

Alternatively you can install the Loki and Fluent Bit all together using:

```bash
helm upgrade --install loki-stack loki/loki-stack \
    --set fluent-bit.enabled=true,promtail.enabled=false
```
