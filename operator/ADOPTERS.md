This document tracks people and use cases for the Prometheus Operator in production. By creating a list of production use cases we hope to build a community of advisors that we can reach out to with experience using various the Prometheus Operator applications, operation environments, and cluster sizes. The Prometheus Operator development team may reach out periodically to check-in on how the Prometheus Operator is working in the field and update this list.

Go ahead and [add your organization](https://github.com/grafana/loki/edit/main/operator/ADOPTERS.md) to the list.
