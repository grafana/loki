                                Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be

                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                                If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                                Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                                If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                        with respect to the current state of the instance.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
