// Package controllerruntime provides tools to construct Kubernetes-style
// controllers that manipulate both Kubernetes CRDs and aggregated/built-in
// Kubernetes APIs.
//
// It defines easy helpers for the common use cases when building CRDs, built
// on top of customizable layers of abstraction.  Common cases should be easy,
// and uncommon cases should be possible.  In general, controller-runtime tries
// to guide users towards Kubernetes controller best-practices.
//
// Getting Started
//
// The main entrypoint for controller-runtime is this root package, which
// contains all of the common types needed to get started building controllers:
//  import (
//      ctrl "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime"
//  )
//
// The examples in this package walk through a basic controller setup.  The
// kubebuilder book (https://book.kubebuilder.io) has some more in-depth
// walkthroughs.
//
// controller-runtime favors structs with sane defaults over constructors, so
// it's fairly common to see structs being used directly in controller-runtime.
//
// Organization
//
// A brief-ish walkthrough of the layout of this library can be found below. Each
// package contains more information about how to use it.
//
// Frequently asked questions about using controller-runtime and designing
// controllers can be found at
// https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/master/FAQ.md.
//
// Managers
//
// Every controller and webhook is ultimately run by a Manager (pkg/manager). A
// manager is responsible for running controllers and webhooks, and setting up
// common dependencies (pkg/runtime/inject), like shared caches and clients, as
// well as managing leader election (pkg/leaderelection).  Managers are
// generally configured to gracefully shut down controllers on pod termination
// by wiring up a signal handler (pkg/manager/signals).
//
// Controllers
//
// Controllers (pkg/controller) use events (pkg/events) to eventually trigger
// reconcile requests.  They may be constructed manually, but are often
// constructed with a Builder (pkg/builder), which eases the wiring of event
// sources (pkg/source), like Kubernetes API object changes, to event handlers
// (pkg/handler), like "enqueue a reconcile request for the object owner".
// Predicates (pkg/predicate) can be used to filter which events actually
// trigger reconciles.  There are pre-written utilities for the common cases, and
// interfaces and helpers for advanced cases.
//
// Reconcilers
//
// Controller logic is implemented in terms of Reconcilers (pkg/reconcile).  A
// Reconciler implements a function which takes a reconcile Request containing
// the name and namespace of the object to reconcile, reconciles the object,
// and returns a Response or an error indicating whether to requeue for a
// second round of processing.
//
// Clients and Caches
//
// Reconcilers use Clients (pkg/client) to access API objects.  The default
// client provided by the manager reads from a local shared cache (pkg/cache)
// and writes directly to the API server, but clients can be constructed that
// only talk to the API server, without a cache.  The Cache will auto-populate
// with watched objects, as well as when other structured objects are
// requested. The default split client does not promise to invalidate the cache
// during writes (nor does it promise sequential create/get coherence), and code
// should not assume a get immediately following a create/update will return
// the updated resource. Caches may also have indexes, which can be created via
// a FieldIndexer (pkg/client) obtained from the manager.  Indexes can used to
// quickly and easily look up all objects with certain fields set.  Reconcilers
// may retrieve event recorders (pkg/recorder) to emit events using the
// manager.
//
// Schemes
//
// Clients, Caches, and many other things in Kubernetes use Schemes
// (pkg/scheme) to associate Go types to Kubernetes API Kinds
// (Group-Version-Kinds, to be specific).
//
// Webhooks
//
// Similarly, webhooks (pkg/webhook/admission) may be implemented directly, but
// are often constructed using a builder (pkg/webhook/admission/builder).  They
// are run via a server (pkg/webhook) which is managed by a Manager.
//
// Logging and Metrics
//
// Logging (pkg/log) in controller-runtime is done via structured logs, using a
// log set of interfaces called logr
// (https://godoc.org/github.com/go-logr/logr).  While controller-runtime
// provides easy setup for using Zap (https://go.uber.org/zap, pkg/log/zap),
// you can provide any implementation of logr as the base logger for
// controller-runtime.
//
// Metrics (pkg/metrics) provided by controller-runtime are registered into a
// controller-runtime-specific Prometheus metrics registry.  The manager can
// serve these by an HTTP endpoint, and additional metrics may be registered to
// this Registry as normal.
//
// Testing
//
// You can easily build integration and unit tests for your controllers and
// webhooks using the test Environment (pkg/envtest).  This will automatically
// stand up a copy of etcd and kube-apiserver, and provide the correct options
// to connect to the API server.  It's designed to work well with the Ginkgo
// testing framework, but should work with any testing setup.
