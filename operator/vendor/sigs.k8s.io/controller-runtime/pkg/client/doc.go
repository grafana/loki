// Package client contains functionality for interacting with Kubernetes API
// servers.
//
// Clients
//
// Clients are split into two interfaces -- Readers and Writers.   Readers
// get and list, while writers create, update, and delete.
//
// The New function can be used to create a new client that talks directly
// to the API server.
//
// A common pattern in Kubernetes to read from a cache and write to the API
// server.  This pattern is covered by the DelegatingClient type, which can
// be used to have a client whose Reader is different from the Writer.
//
// Options
//
// Many client operations in Kubernetes support options.  These options are
// represented as variadic arguments at the end of a given method call.
// For instance, to use a label selector on list, you can call
//  err := someReader.List(context.Background(), &podList, client.MatchingLabels{"somelabel": "someval"})
//
// Indexing
//
// Indexes may be added to caches using a FieldIndexer.  This allows you to easily
// and efficiently look up objects with certain properties.  You can then make
// use of the index by specifying a field selector on calls to List on the Reader
// corresponding to the given Cache.
//
// For instance, a Secret controller might have an index on the
// `.spec.volumes.secret.secretName` field in Pod objects, so that it could
// easily look up all pods that reference a given secret.
