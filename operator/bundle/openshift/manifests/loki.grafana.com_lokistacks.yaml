                            the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

                                Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                                When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                                Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.

                                Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                              DisableRecommendedAttributes can be used to reduce the number of attributes used as stream labels.

                              Enabling this setting removes the "recommended attributes" from the generated Loki configuration. This will cause
                              some stream labels to disappear from the index, potentially making queries more expensive and less performant.

                              Note that there is a set of "required attributes", needed for OpenShift Logging to work properly. Those will be
                              added to the configuration, even if this field is set to true.

                              This option is supposed to be combined with a custom attribute configuration listing the stream labels that
                              should continue to exist.

                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
