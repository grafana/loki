The Loki Operator provides [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) native deployment and management of [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) and related logging components.
The purpose of this project is to simplify and automate the configuration of a Loki based logging stack for Kubernetes clusters.

The Loki operator includes, but is not limited to, the following features:

* Kubernetes Custom Resources: Use Kubernetes custom resources to deploy and manage Loki, Alerting rules, Recording rules, and related components.
* Simplified Deployment Configuration: Configure the fundamentals of Loki like tenants, limits, replication factor and storage from a native Kubernetes resource.
