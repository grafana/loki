The following page describes Standard Operational Procedures for alerts provided and managed by the Loki Operator for any LokiStack instance.

## Loki Request Errors

### Impact

A service(s) is unable to perform its duties for a number of requests, resulting in potential loss of data.

### Summary

A service(s) is failing to process at least 10% of all incoming requests.

### Severity

`Critical`

### Access Required

- Console access to the cluster
- Edit access to the deployed operator and Loki namespace:
  - OpenShift
    - `openshift-logging` (LokiStack)
    - `openshift-operators-redhat` (Loki Operator)

### Steps

- Check the logs of the service that is emitting the server error (5XX)
- Ensure that store services (`ingester`, `querier`, `index-gateway`, `compactor`) can communicate with backend storage
- Examine metrics for signs of failure
  - WAL Complications
    - `loki_ingester_wal_disk_full_failures_total`
    - `loki_ingester_wal_corruptions_total`

## LokiStack Write Request Errors

### Impact

The LokiStack Gateway component is unable to perform its duties for a number of write requests, resulting in potential loss of data.

### Summary

The LokiStack Gateway is failing to process at least 10% of all incoming write requests.

### Severity

`Critical`

### Access Required

- Console access to the cluster
- Edit access to the deployed operator and Loki namespace:
  - OpenShift
    - `openshift-logging` (LokiStack)
    - `openshift-operators-redhat` (Loki Operator)

### Steps

- Ensure that the LokiStack Gateway component is ready and available
- Ensure that the `distributor`, `ingester`, and `index-gateway` components are ready and available
- Ensure that store services (`ingester`, `querier`, `index-gateway`, `compactor`) can communicate with backend storage
- Examine metrics for signs of failure
  - WAL Complications
    - `loki_ingester_wal_disk_full_failures_total`
    - `loki_ingester_wal_corruptions_total`

## LokiStack Read Request Errors

### Impact

The LokiStack Gateway component is unable to perform its duties for a number of query requests, resulting in a potential disruption.

### Summary

The LokiStack Gateway is failing to process at least 10% of all incoming query requests.

### Severity

`Critical`

### Access Required

- Console access to the cluster
- Edit access to the deployed operator and Loki namespace:
  - OpenShift
    - `openshift-logging` (LokiStack)
    - `openshift-operators-redhat` (Loki Operator)

### Steps

- Ensure that the LokiStack Gateway component is ready and available
- Ensure that the `query-frontend`, `querier`, `ingester`, and `index-gateway` components are ready and available
- Ensure that store services (`ingester`, `querier`, `index-gateway`, `compactor`) can communicate with backend storage
- Examine metrics for signs of failure
  - WAL Complications
    - `loki_ingester_wal_disk_full_failures_total`
    - `loki_ingester_wal_corruptions_total`

## Loki Request Panics

### Impact

A service(s) is unavailable to unavailable, resulting in potential loss of data.

### Summary

A service(s) has crashed.

### Severity

`Critical`

### Access Required

- Console access to the cluster
- Edit access to the deployed operator and Loki namespace:
  - OpenShift
    - `openshift-logging` (LokiStack)
    - `openshift-operators-redhat` (Loki Operator)

### Steps

- Check the logs of the service that is panicking
- Examine metrics for signs of failure

## Loki Request Latency

### Impact

A service(s) is affected by slow request responses.

### Summary

A service(s) is slower than expected at processing data.

### Severity

`Critical`

### Access Required

- Console access to the cluster
- Edit access to the deployed operator and Loki namespace:
  - OpenShift
    - `openshift-logging` (LokiStack)
    - `openshift-operators-redhat` (Loki Operator)

### Steps

- Check the logs of all the services
- Check to ensure that the Loki components can reach the storage
  - Particularly for queriers, examine metrics for a small query queue: `cortex_query_scheduler_inflight_requests`

## Loki Tenant Rate Limit

### Impact

A tenant is being rate limited, resulting in potential loss of data.

### Summary

A service(s) is rate limiting at least 10% of all incoming requests.

### Severity

`Warning`

### Access Required

- Console access to the cluster
- Edit access to the deployed operator and Loki namespace:
  - OpenShift
    - `openshift-logging` (LokiStack)
    - `openshift-operators-redhat` (Loki Operator)

### Steps

- Examine the metrics for the reason and tenant that is being limited: `loki_discarded_samples_total{namespace="<namespace>"}`
- Increase the limits allocated to the tenant in the LokiStack CRD
  - For ingestion limits, please consult the table below
  - For query limits, the `MaxEntriesLimitPerQuery`, `MaxChunksPerQuery`, or `MaxQuerySeries` can be changed to raise the limit

| Reason | Corresponding Ingestion Limit Keys |
| --- | --- |
| `rate_limited` | `ingestionRate`, `ingestionBurstSize` |
| `stream_limit` | `maxGlobalStreamsPerTenant` |
| `label_name_too_long` | `maxLabelNameLength` |
| `label_value_too_long` | `maxLabelValueLength` |
| `line_too_long` | `maxLineSize` |
| `max_label_names_per_series` | `maxLabelNamesPerSeries` |
| `per_stream_rate_limit` | `perStreamRateLimit`, `perStreamRateLimitBurst` |


## Loki Storage Slow Write

### Impact

The cluster is unable to push logs to backend storage in a timely manner.

### Summary

The cluster is unable to push logs to backend storage in a timely manner.

### Severity

`Warning`

### Access Required

- Console access to the cluster
- Edit access to the deployed operator and Loki namespace:
  - OpenShift
    - `openshift-logging` (LokiStack)
    - `openshift-operators-redhat` (Loki Operator)

### Steps

- Ensure that the cluster can communicate with the backend storage

## Loki Storage Slow Read

### Impact
