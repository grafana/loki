                                      There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                                      * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                                      * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                                      Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

                                      Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                                      boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                                      allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                                      Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                                      generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                                      routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                                      any namespace to the Service.

                                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                                      "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                                      connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                                      the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                                      ParentRef of the Route.

                                      Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                      differently based on the type of parent resource.

                                      When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                      listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                      select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                      networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                      as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                      and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                      must match both specified values.

                                      Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                      Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly

                                      long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                      from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                      attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                      the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

            A CertificateRequest is used to request a signed certificate from one of the
            configured issuers.

            All fields within the CertificateRequest's `spec` are immutable after creation.
            A CertificateRequest will either succeed or fail, as denoted by its `Ready` status
            condition and its `status.failureTime` field.

            A CertificateRequest is a one-shot resource, meaning it represents a single
            point in time request for a certificate and cannot be re-used.

                                      help compute the correct AWS credential scope and partition when it
                                      connects to Route53. See:

                                      If you omit this region field, cert-manager will use the region from
                                      AWS_REGION and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment variables, if they are set
                                      in the cert-manager controller Pod.

                                      The `region` field is not needed if you use [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).
                                      Instead an AWS_REGION environment variable is added to the cert-manager controller Pod by:

                                      In this case this `region` field value is ignored.

                                      The `region` field is not needed if you use [EKS Pod Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-identities.html).

                                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                                            "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                                            connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                                            the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                                            ParentRef of the Route.

                                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                            must match both specified values.

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                            SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the

                                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is

                                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                                                  Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume
                                                  to be owned by the pod:

                                                  3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----

                                                  If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.

                                      In this case this `region` field value is ignored.

                                            When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                                            Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                                            the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                            SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the

                                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                            both specified values.
                                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                            interpreted.

                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
