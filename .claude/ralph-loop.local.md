Create or refine a PLAN.md based on features and functionality that Loki has for handing JSON logs - for both ingestion, compaction, indexing and querying. Produce a plan for matching level of capabilities for XML. Build tests for XML mimicing JSON tests and continue developing XML supprt functionality until all tests pass and there is a parity in functionality and performance between JSON and XML. You are only done when all JSON comparable features are available for XML and it performs on the same level.
