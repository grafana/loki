# This file should contain a list fo deprecated config options.
#
# The value for a deprecated option should be a message that explains why the option is deprecated and what to use instead. E.g.
# storage_config:
#  cassandra: "Cassandra is deprecated. Use any other non-deprecated storage instead.
#
# A given set of deprecated values can also be given though the _deprecated field along with a message in the _msg field. E.g.
# schema_config:
#   configs:
#     store:
#       _deprecated: ["aws", "aws-dynamo", "gcp", "gcp-columnkey", "bigtable", "bigtable-hashed", "cassandra", "grpc"]
#       _msg: "Use tsdb (preferred) or boltdb-shipper instead."
#
# Note that even though the configs in schema_config takes a list, here we specify the deprecated fields for each item in the list.

# TODO:
# - ruler.storage: Use -ruler-storage.
#      I cannot find where ruler-storage is defined.
# - index_gateway.replication_factor: Use -index-gateway.shard-size instead. The shard size is also a per-tenant setting.
#      I'm not sure which shard-size is being referred to here.
