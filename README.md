# Logish: Like Prometheus, but for logs.

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/grafana/logish/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=618193e5787b2951c1ea3352ad5f254f4f52313d)](https://circleci.com/gh/grafana/logish/tree/master) [Design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11tjK_lvp1-SVsFZjgOTr1vV3-q6vBAsZYIQ5ZeYBkyM/edit)

Logish is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant, log aggregation
system inspired by Prometheus.  It is design to be very cost effective, as it does
not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log steam.

## Usage Instructions

Logish is running in the ops-tools1 cluster.  You can query logs from that cluster
using the following commands:

```
$ go get github.com/grafana/logish/cmd/logcli
$ . $GOPATH/src/github.com/grafana/logish/env # env vars inc. URL, username etc
$ logcli labels job
https://logs-dev-ops-tools1.grafana.net/api/prom/label/job/values
cortex-ops/consul
cortex-ops/cortex-gw
...
$ logcli query '{job="cortex-ops/consul"}'
https://logs-dev-ops-tools1.grafana.net/api/prom/query?query=%7Bjob%3D%22cortex-ops%2Fconsul%22%7D&limit=30&start=1529928228&end=1529931828&direction=backward&regexp=
Common labels: {job="cortex-ops/consul", namespace="cortex-ops"}
2018-06-25T12:52:09Z {instance="consul-8576459955-pl75w"} 2018/06/25 12:52:09 [INFO] raft: Snapshot to 475409 complete
2018-06-25T12:52:09Z {instance="consul-8576459955-pl75w"} 2018/06/25 12:52:09 [INFO] raft: Compacting logs from 456973 to 465169
```

The `logcli` command is temporary until we have Grafana integration. The URLs of
the requests are printed to help with integration work.

```
$ logcli help
usage: logcli [<flags>] <command> [<args> ...]

A command-line for logish.

Flags:
  --help         Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
  --addr="https://log-us.grafana.net"
                 Server address.
  --username=""  Username for HTTP basic auth.
  --password=""  Password for HTTP basic auth.

Commands:
  help [<command>...]
    Show help.

  query [<flags>] <query> [<regex>]
    Run a LogQL query.

  labels <label>
    Find values for a given label.

$ logcli help query
usage: logcli query [<flags>] <query> [<regex>]

Run a LogQL query.

Flags:
  --help         Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
  --addr="https://log-us.grafana.net"
                 Server address.
  --username=""  Username for HTTP basic auth.
  --password=""  Password for HTTP basic auth.
  --limit=30     Limit on number of entries to print.
  --since=1h     Lookback window.
  --forward      Scan forwards through logs.

Args:
  <query>    eg '{foo="bar",baz="blip"}'
  [<regex>]
```

## API

*nb* Authentication is out of scope for this project.  You are expected to run an
authenticating reverse proxy in front of our services, such as an Nginx with basic
auth or a OAuth2 proxy.

There are 4 API endpoints:

- `POST /api/prom/push`

  For sending log entries, expects a snappy compresses proto in the HTTP Body.

- `GET /api/prom/query`

  For doing queries, accepts the following paramters in the query-string:
  - `query`: a logQL query
  - `limit`: max number of entries to return
  - `start`: the start time for the query, as a nanosecond Unix epoch (nanoseconds since 1970)
  - `end`: the end time for the query, as a nanosecond Unix epoch (nanoseconds since 1970)
  - `direction`: `forward` or `backward`, useful when specifying a limit
  - `regexp`: a regex to filter the returned results, will eventually be rolled into the query language

  Responses looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "streams": [
      {
        "labels": "{instance=\"...\", job=\"...\", namespace=\"...\"}",
        "entries": [
          {
            "timestamp": "2018-06-27T05:20:28.699492635Z",
            "line": "..."
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/prom/label`

  For retrieving the names of the labels one can query on.

  Responses looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "values": [
      "instance",
      "job",
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/prom/label/<name>/values`
  For retrieving the label values one can query on.

  Responses looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "values": [
      "default",
      "cortex-ops",
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
