# Drone CI builds arm32 images using armv8l rather than armv7l. Something in
# our build process above causes ldconfig to be rerun and removes the armhf
# library that debian:stretch-slim on ARM comes with. Symbolically linking to
# ld-linux.so.3 fixes the problem and allows Promtail to start.
#
# This process isn't necessary when building on armv7l so we only do it if the
# library was removed.
