# `zombiezen.com/go/sqlite` Contributor's Guide

`zombiezen.com/go/sqlite` is [@zombiezen's][zombiezen] labor of love
in providing a pleasant, performant, and powerful Go binding to SQLite.
The design philosophy of `zombiezen.com/go/sqlite`
is to be a direct binding to SQLite as much as possible
while adapting the API to use Go idioms.

@zombiezen is open to accepting bug fixes,
but generally not larger changes or features.
If in doubt, ask them.
