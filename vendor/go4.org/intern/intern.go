// Interning is simple if you don't require that unused values be
// garbage collectable. But we do require that; we don't want to be
// DOS vector. We do this by using a uintptr to hide the pointer from
// the garbage collector, and using a finalizer to eliminate the
// pointer when no other code is using it.
//
// The obvious implementation of this is to use a
// map[interface{}]uintptr-of-*interface{}, and set up a finalizer to
// delete from the map. Unfortunately, this is racy. Because pointers
// are being created in violation of Go's unsafety rules, it's
// possible to create a pointer to a value concurrently with the GC
// concluding that the value can be collected. There are other races
// that break the equality invariant as well, but the use-after-free
// will cause a runtime crash.
//
// To make this work, the finalizer needs to know that no references
// have been unsafely created since the finalizer was set up. To do
// this, values carry a "resurrected" sentinel, which gets set
// whenever a pointer is unsafely created. If the finalizer encounters
// the sentinel, it clears the sentinel and delays collection for one
// additional GC cycle, by re-installing itself as finalizer. This
// ensures that the unsafely created pointer is visible to the GC, and
// will correctly prevent collection.
//
// This technique does mean that interned values that get reused take
// at least 3 GC cycles to fully collect (1 to clear the sentinel, 1
// to clean up the unsafe map, 1 to be actually deleted).
//
// @ianlancetaylor commented in
// https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41303#issuecomment-717401656
// that it is possible to implement weak references in terms of
// finalizers without unsafe. Unfortunately, the approach he outlined
// does not work here, for two reasons. First, there is no way to
// construct a strong pointer out of a weak pointer; our map stores
// weak pointers, but we must return strong pointers to callers.
// Second, and more fundamentally, we must return not just _a_ strong
// pointer to callers, but _the same_ strong pointer to callers. In
// order to return _the same_ strong pointer to callers, we must track
// it, which is exactly what we cannot do with strong pointers.
//
// See https://github.com/inetaf/netaddr/issues/53 for more
// discussion, and https://github.com/go4org/intern/issues/2 for an
// illustration of the subtleties at play.
