//    glibc includes corresponding *f128 interfaces for it.  The required
//    libgcc support was added some time after the basic compiler
//    support, for x86_64 and x86.

// Defined to 1 if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1 and the type is ABI-distinct
//    from the default float, double and long double types in this glibc.

// Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
//    floating-point type with the right format for _Float64x, and this
//    glibc includes corresponding *f64x interfaces for it.

// Defined to 1 if __HAVE_FLOAT64X is 1 and _Float64x has the format
//    of long double.  Otherwise, if __HAVE_FLOAT64X is 1, _Float64x has
//    the format of _Float128, which must be different from that of long
//    double.

// Defined to concatenate the literal suffix to be used with _Float128
//    types, if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1.

// Defined to a complex binary128 type if __HAVE_FLOAT128 is 1.

// The remaining of this file provides support for older compilers.

//    attempts to use _Float128 sNaNs will not work properly with older
//    compilers.

//    e.g.: __builtin_signbitf128, before GCC 6.  However, there has never

// long double is distinct from double, so there is nothing to
//    define here.

// This header should be included at the bottom of each bits/floatn.h.
//    It defines the following macros for each _FloatN and _FloatNx type,
//    where the same definitions, or definitions based only on the macros
//    in bits/floatn.h, are appropriate for all glibc configurations.

// Defined to 1 if the current compiler invocation provides a
//    floating-point type with the right format for this type, and this
//    glibc includes corresponding *fN or *fNx interfaces for it.

// Defined to 1 if the corresponding __HAVE_<type> macro is 1 and the
//    type is the first with its format in the sequence of (the default
//    choices for) float, double, long double, _Float16, _Float32,
//    _Float64, _Float128, _Float32x, _Float64x, _Float128x for this
//    glibc; that is, if functions present once per floating-point format
//    rather than once per type are present for this type.
//
//    All configurations supported by glibc have _Float32 the same format
//    as float, _Float64 and _Float32x the same format as double, the
//    _Float64x the same format as either long double or _Float128.  No
//    configurations support _Float128x or, as of GCC 7, have compiler
//    support for a type meeting the requirements for _Float128x.

// Defined to 1 if the corresponding _FloatN type is not binary compatible
//    with the corresponding ISO C type in the current compilation unit as
//    opposed to __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOATN, which indicates the default types built
//    in glibc.

// Defined to 1 if any _FloatN or _FloatNx types that are not
//    ABI-distinct are however distinct types at the C language level (so
//    for the purposes of __builtin_types_compatible_p and _Generic).

// Defined to concatenate the literal suffix to be used with _FloatN
//    or _FloatNx types, if __HAVE_<type> is 1.  The corresponding
//    literal suffixes exist since GCC 7, for C only.

// Defined to a complex type if __HAVE_<type> is 1.

// The remaining of this file provides support for older compilers.

// If double, long double and _Float64 all have the same set of
//    values, TS 18661-3 requires the usual arithmetic conversions on
//    long double and _Float64 to produce _Float64.  For this to be the
//    case when building with a compiler without a distinct _Float64
//    type, _Float64 must be a typedef for long double, not for
//    double.

// The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
//    macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
//    of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
//    We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
//    variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.
//
// 	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
// 	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
// 	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
// 	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
// 	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
// 	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
// 	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long
//
//    We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
//    conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
//    types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
//    This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
//    these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
//    make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
//    we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
//    compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
//    and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
//    program's portability.
//
//    Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
//    we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
//    and int is always 32 bits.

// We want __extension__ before typedef's that use nonstandard base types
//    such as `long long' in C89 mode.
