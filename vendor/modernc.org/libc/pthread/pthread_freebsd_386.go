// According to ANSI (section 2.2.4.2), the values below must be usable by
// #if preprocessing directives.  Additionally, the expression must have the
// same type as would an expression that is an object of the corresponding
// type converted according to the integral promotions.  The subtraction for
// INT_MIN, etc., is so the value is not unsigned; e.g., 0x80000000 is an
// unsigned int for 32-bit two's complement ANSI compilers (section 3.1.3.2).

// Unusual type definitions.
// rune_t is declared to be an “int” instead of the more natural
// “unsigned long” or “long”.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
// unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
// it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
// ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
// chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
// ANSI C), but they use __ct_rune_t instead of int.
//
// NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
// be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wint_t and
// rune_t must be the same type.  Also, wint_t should be able to hold all
// members of the largest character set plus one extra value (WEOF), and
// must be at least 16 bits.
type X__ct_rune_t = int32     /* _types.h:91:14 */ // arg type for ctype funcs

type X__wint_t = X__ct_rune_t /* _types.h:93:21 */ // wint_t (see above)

// Clang already provides these types as built-ins, but only in C++ mode.
type X__char16_t = X__uint_least16_t /* _types.h:97:26 */
type X__char32_t = X__uint_least32_t /* _types.h:98:26 */
// In C++11, char16_t and char32_t are built-in types.

// the ones FreeBSD traditionally used based on our reading of the POSIX
// standards. However, glibc uses 199309 for all of them, even those many were
// not defined there. To remain bug compatible with glibc means more software
// that relied on the glibc behavior will compile easily on FreeBSD.
//
// Also, CLOCK_UPTIME_FAST is improperly visible temporarily for the lang/pocl
// port until it can be updated properly. It incorrectly assumes that this was a
// standard value. It will be moved back to the __BSD_VISIBLE section once the
// issue is corrected.

// FreeBSD-specific clocks.

// Linux compatible names.

// Frequency of the clock ticks reported by times().  Deprecated - use
// sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) instead.  (Removed in 1003.1-2001.)

// Frequency of the clock ticks reported by clock().

// New in POSIX 1003.1b-1993.
