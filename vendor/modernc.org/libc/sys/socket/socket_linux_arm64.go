// The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE

//    We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
//    variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.
//
// 	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
// 	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
// 	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
// 	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
// 	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
// 	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
// 	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long
//
//    We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
//    conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
//    types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
//    This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
//    these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
//    make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
//    we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
//    compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
//    and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
//    program's portability.
//
//    Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
//    we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
//    and int is always 32 bits.

// Any one of these symbols __need_* means that GNU libc
//    wants us just to define one data type.  So don't define
//    the symbols that indicate this file's entire job has been done.

// This avoids lossage on SunOS but only if stdtypes.h comes first.
//    There's no way to win with the other order!  Sun lossage.

// Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.
//    Just ignore it.

// On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
//    _TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the
//    vxTypesBase.h so that this macro is only defined if _GCC_SIZE_T is
//    not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.
//    If we find that the macros are still defined at this point, we must
//    invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.

// In case nobody has defined these types, but we aren't running under
//    GCC 2.00, make sure that __PTRDIFF_TYPE__, __SIZE_TYPE__, and
//    __WCHAR_TYPE__ have reasonable values.  This can happen if the
//    parts of GCC is compiled by an older compiler, that actually
