// Component is either a receiver, exporter, processor, connector, or an extension.
//
// A component's lifecycle has the following phases:
//
//  1. Creation: The component is created using its respective factory, via a Create* call.
//  2. Start: The component's Start method is called.
//  3. Running: The component is up and running.
//  4. Shutdown: The component's Shutdown method is called and the lifecycle is complete.
//
// Once the lifecycle is complete it may be repeated, in which case a new component
// is created, starts, runs and is shutdown again.
type Component interface {
	// Start tells the component to start. Host parameter can be used for communicating
	// with the host after Start() has already returned. If an error is returned by
	// Start() then the collector startup will be aborted.
	// If this is an exporter component it may prepare for exporting
	// by connecting to the endpoint.
	//
	// If the component needs to perform a long-running starting operation then it is recommended
	// that Start() returns quickly and the long-running operation is performed in background.
	// In that case make sure that the long-running operation does not use the context passed
	// to Start() function since that context will be cancelled soon and can abort the long-running
	// operation. Create a new context from the context.Background() for long-running operations.
	Start(ctx context.Context, host Host) error

	// Shutdown is invoked during service shutdown. After Shutdown() is called, if the component
	// accepted data in any way, it should not accept it anymore.
	//
	// This method must be safe to call:
	//   - without Start() having been called
	//   - if the component is in a shutdown state already
	//
	// If there are any background operations running by the component they must be aborted before
	// this function returns. Remember that if you started any long-running background operations from
	// the Start() method, those operations must be also cancelled. If there are any buffers in the
	// component, they should be cleared and the data sent immediately to the next component.
	//
	// The component's lifecycle is completed once the Shutdown() method returns. No other
	// methods of the component are called after that. If necessary a new component with
	// the same or different configuration may be created and started (this may happen
	// for example if we want to restart the component).
