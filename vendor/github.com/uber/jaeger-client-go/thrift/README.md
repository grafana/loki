# Apache Thrift

This is a partial copy of Apache Thrift v0.14.1 (https://github.com/apache/thrift/commit/f6fa1794539e68ac294038ac388d6bde40a6c237).

It is vendored code to avoid compatibility issues with Thrift versions.

The file logger.go is modified to remove dependency on "testing" (see Issue #585).
