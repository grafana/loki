Package logfmt implements utilities to marshal and unmarshal data in the [logfmt
format][fmt]. It provides an API similar to [encoding/json][json] and
[encoding/xml][xml].

[fmt]: https://brandur.org/logfmt
[json]: https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json
[xml]: https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/xml

The logfmt format was first documented by Brandur Leach in [this
article][origin]. The format has not been formally standardized. The most
authoritative public specification to date has been the documentation of a Go
Language [package][parser] written by Blake Mizerany and Keith Rarick.

## Goals

This project attempts to conform as closely as possible to the prior art, while
also removing ambiguity where necessary to provide well behaved encoder and
decoder implementations.

## Non-goals

This project does not attempt to formally standardize the logfmt format. In the
event that logfmt is standardized this project would take conforming to the
standard as a goal.

## Versioning

This project publishes releases according to the Go language guidelines for
[developing and publishing modules][pub].
