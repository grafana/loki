// some state of what the client is interested in. For example, say that you
// are interested in thousands of topics, and most of these topics are
// receiving data only rarely. A fetch session allows the client to register
// that it is interested in those thousands of topics on the first request.  On
// future requests, if the offsets for these topics have not changed, those
// topics will be elided from the request. The broker knows to reply with the
// extra topics if any new data is available, otherwise the topics are also
// elided from the response. This massively reduces the amount of information
// that needs to be included in requests or responses.
//
// Using fetch sessions means more state is stored on brokers. Maintaining this
// state eats some memory. If you have thousands of consumers, you may not want
// fetch sessions to be used for everything. Brokers intelligently handle this
// by not creating sessions if they are at their configured limit, but you may
// consider disabling sessions if they are generally not useful to you. Brokers
// have metrics for the number of fetch sessions active, so you can monitor

// If you use this option, you should ensure that you always process records
