// HeapProfiler is a stateful profiler for heap allocations in Go programs.
// It is based on runtime.MemProfile and provides similar functionality to
// pprof.WriteHeapProfile, but with some key differences.
//
// The HeapProfiler tracks the delta of heap allocations since the last
// profile was written, effectively providing a snapshot of the changes
// in heap usage between two points in time. This is in contrast to the
// pprof.WriteHeapProfile function, which accumulates profiling data
// and results in profiles that represent the entire lifetime of the program.
//
// The HeapProfiler is safe for concurrent use, as it serializes access to
// its internal state using a sync.Mutex. This ensures that multiple goroutines
// can call the Profile method without causing any data race issues.
//
// Usage:
//
//	hp := godeltaprof.NewHeapProfiler()
//	...
//	err := hp.Profile(someWriter)
