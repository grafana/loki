# Release History

## 0.21.0 (2022-01-11)

### Features Added
* Added `AllowedHeaders` and `AllowedQueryParams` to `policy.LogOptions` to control which headers and query parameters are written to the logger.
* Added `azcore.ResponseError` type which is returned from APIs when a non-success HTTP status code is received.

* Renamed `arm/ClientOptions.Host` to `.Endpoint`
* Moved `Request.SkipBodyDownload` method to function `runtime.SkipBodyDownload`
* Removed `azcore.HTTPResponse` interface type
* `arm.NewPoller()` and `runtime.NewPoller()` no longer require an `eu` parameter
* `runtime.NewResponseError()` no longer requires an `error` parameter

## 0.20.0 (2021-10-22)

### Breaking Changes
* Removed `arm.Connection`
* Removed `azcore.Credential` and `.NewAnonymousCredential()`
  * `NewRPRegistrationPolicy` now requires an `azcore.TokenCredential`
* `runtime.NewPipeline` has a new signature that simplifies implementing custom authentication
* `arm/runtime.RegistrationOptions` embeds `policy.ClientOptions`
* Contents in the `log` package have been slightly renamed.
* Removed `AuthenticationOptions` in favor of `policy.BearerTokenOptions`
* Changed parameters for `NewBearerTokenPolicy()`
* Moved policy config options out of `arm/runtime` and into `arm/policy`

### Features Added
* Updating Documentation
* Added string typdef `arm.Endpoint` to provide a hint toward expected ARM client endpoints
* `azcore.ClientOptions` contains common pipeline configuration settings
* Added support for multi-tenant authorization in `arm/runtime`
* Require one second minimum when calling `PollUntilDone()`

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a potential panic when creating the default Transporter.
* Close LRO initial response body when creating a poller.
* Fixed a panic when recursively cloning structs that contain time.Time.

## 0.19.0 (2021-08-25)

### Breaking Changes
* Split content out of `azcore` into various packages.  The intent is to separate content based on its usage (common, uncommon, SDK authors).
  * `azcore` has all core functionality.
  * `log` contains facilities for configuring in-box logging.
  * `policy` is used for configuring pipeline options and creating custom pipeline policies.
  * `runtime` contains various helpers used by SDK authors and generated content.
  * `streaming` has helpers for streaming IO operations.
* `NewTelemetryPolicy()` now requires module and version parameters and the `Value` option has been removed.
  * As a result, the `Request.Telemetry()` method has been removed.
* The telemetry policy now includes the SDK prefix `azsdk-go-` so callers no longer need to provide it.
* The `*http.Request` in `runtime.Request` is no longer anonymously embedded.  Use the `Raw()` method to access it.
* The `UserAgent` and `Version` constants have been made internal, `Module` and `Version` respectively.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue in the retry policy where the request body could be overwritten after a rewind.

### Other Changes
* Moved modules `armcore` and `to` content into `arm` and `to` packages respectively.
  * The `Pipeline()` method on `armcore.Connection` has been replaced by `NewPipeline()` in `arm.Connection`.  It takes module and version parameters used by the telemetry policy.
* Poller logic has been consolidated across ARM and core implementations.
  * This required some changes to the internal interfaces for core pollers.
* The core poller types have been improved, including more logging and test coverage.
