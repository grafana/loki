# Contributing to Cortex

Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing. Below are some basic guidelines.

## Workflow

Cortex follows a standard GitHub pull request workflow. If you're unfamiliar with this workflow, read the very helpful [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) guide from GitHub.

## Developer Certificates of Origin (DCOs)

Before submitting your work in a pull request, make sure that *all* commits are signed off with a **Developer Certificate of Origin** (DCO). Here's an example:

```shell
git commit -s -m "Here is my signed commit"
```

You can find further instructions [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
