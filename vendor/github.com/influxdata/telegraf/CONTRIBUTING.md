#### Contributing an External Plugin *(experimental)*
Input, output, and processor plugins written for internal Telegraf can be run as externally-compiled plugins through the [Execd Input](plugins/inputs/execd), [Execd Output](/plugins/inputs/execd), and [Execd Processor](plugins/processors/execd) Plugins without having to change the plugin code.

Follow the guidelines of how to integrate your plugin with the [Execd Go Shim](/plugins/common/shim) to easily compile it as a separate app and run it with the respective `execd` plugin. 
Check out our [guidelines](docs/EXTERNAL_PLUGINS.md#external-plugin-guidelines) on how to build and set up your external plugins to run with `execd`.

### GoDoc

Public interfaces for inputs, outputs, processors, aggregators, metrics,
and the accumulator can be found in the GoDoc:

### Common development tasks

**Adding a dependency:**

Telegraf uses Go modules. Assuming you can already build the project, run this in the telegraf directory:

1. `go get github.com/[dependency]/[new-package]`

**Unit Tests:**

Before opening a pull request you should run the linter checks and
the short tests.

```
make check
make test
```

**Execute integration tests:**

(Optional)

Running the integration tests requires several docker containers to be
running.  You can start the containers with:
```
docker-compose up
```

And run the full test suite with:
```
make test-all
```

Use `make docker-kill` to stop the containers.
