cli is a simple, fast, and fun package for building command line apps in Go. The
goal is to enable developers to write fast and distributable command line
applications in an expressive way.

## Usage Documentation

Usage documentation exists for each major version

- `v1` - [./docs/v1/manual.md](./docs/v1/manual.md)
- `v2` - ðŸš§ documentation for `v2` is WIP ðŸš§

## Installation

Make sure you have a working Go environment.  Go version 1.10+ is supported.  [See
the install instructions for Go](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).

### GOPATH

Make sure your `PATH` includes the `$GOPATH/bin` directory so your commands can
be easily used:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

### Supported platforms

cli is tested against multiple versions of Go on Linux, and against the latest
released version of Go on OS X and Windows.  For full details, see
[`./.travis.yml`](./.travis.yml) and [`./appveyor.yml`](./appveyor.yml).

$ go get github.com/urfave/cli
