/*
Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields
based on tags.

It can also handle Cross-Field and Cross-Struct validation for nested structs
and has the ability to dive into arrays and maps of any type.

see more examples https://github.com/go-playground/validator/tree/master/_examples

# Singleton

Validator is designed to be thread-safe and used as a singleton instance.
It caches information about your struct and validations,
in essence only parsing your validation tags once per struct type.
Using multiple instances neglects the benefit of caching.
The not thread-safe functions are explicitly marked as such in the documentation.

# Validation Functions Return Type error

Doing things this way is actually the way the standard library does, see the
file.Open method here:

	https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Open.

The authors return type "error" to avoid the issue discussed in the following,
where err is always != nil:

	http://stackoverflow.com/a/29138676/3158232
	https://github.com/go-playground/validator/issues/134

Validator only InvalidValidationError for bad validation input, nil or
ValidationErrors as type error; so, in your code all you need to do is check
if the error returned is not nil, and if it's not check if error is
InvalidValidationError ( if necessary, most of the time it isn't ) type cast
it to type ValidationErrors like so err.(validator.ValidationErrors).

# Custom Validation Functions

Custom Validation functions can be added. Example:

	// Structure
	func customFunc(fl validator.FieldLevel) bool {

		if fl.Field().String() == "invalid" {
			return false
		}

		return true
	}

	validate.RegisterValidation("custom tag name", customFunc)
	// NOTES: using the same tag name as an existing function
	//        will overwrite the existing one

# Cross-Field Validation

Cross-Field Validation can be done via the following tags:
  - eqfield
  - nefield
  - gtfield
  - gtefield
  - ltfield
  - ltefield
  - eqcsfield
  - necsfield
  - gtcsfield
  - gtecsfield
  - ltcsfield
  - ltecsfield

If, however, some custom cross-field validation is required, it can be done
using a custom validation.

Why not just have cross-fields validation tags (i.e. only eqcsfield and not
eqfield)?

The reason is efficiency. If you want to check a field within the same struct
"eqfield" only has to find the field on the same struct (1 level). But, if we
used "eqcsfield" it could be multiple levels down. Example:

	type Inner struct {
		StartDate time.Time
	}

	type Outer struct {
		InnerStructField *Inner
		CreatedAt time.Time      `validate:"ltecsfield=InnerStructField.StartDate"`
	}

	now := time.Now()

	inner := &Inner{
		StartDate: now,
	}

	outer := &Outer{
		InnerStructField: inner,
		CreatedAt: now,
	}

	errs := validate.Struct(outer)

	// NOTE: when calling validate.Struct(val) topStruct will be the top level struct passed
	//       into the function
	//       when calling validate.VarWithValue(val, field, tag) val will be
	//       whatever you pass, struct, field...
	//       when calling validate.Field(field, tag) val will be nil

# Multiple Validators

Multiple validators on a field will process in the order defined. Example:

	type Test struct {
		Field `validate:"max=10,min=1"`
	}

	// max will be checked then min

Bad Validator definitions are not handled by the library. Example:

	type Test struct {
		Field `validate:"min=10,max=0"`
	}

	// this definition of min max will never succeed

# Using Validator Tags

Baked In Cross-Field validation only compares fields on the same struct.
If Cross-Field + Cross-Struct validation is needed you should implement your
own custom validator.

Comma (",") is the default separator of validation tags. If you wish to
have a comma included within the parameter (i.e. excludesall=,) you will need to
use the UTF-8 hex representation 0x2C, which is replaced in the code as a comma,
so the above will become excludesall=0x2C.

	type Test struct {
		Field `validate:"excludesall=,"`    // BAD! Do not include a comma.
		Field `validate:"excludesall=0x2C"` // GOOD! Use the UTF-8 hex representation.
	}

Pipe ("|") is the 'or' validation tags deparator. If you wish to
have a pipe included within the parameter i.e. excludesall=| you will need to
use the UTF-8 hex representation 0x7C, which is replaced in the code as a pipe,
so the above will become excludesall=0x7C

	type Test struct {
		Field `validate:"excludesall=|"`    // BAD! Do not include a pipe!
		Field `validate:"excludesall=0x7C"` // GOOD! Use the UTF-8 hex representation.
	}

# Baked In Validators and Tags

Here is a list of the current built in validators:

# Skip Field

Tells the validation to skip this struct field; this is particularly
handy in ignoring embedded structs from being validated. (Usage: -)

	Usage: -

# Or Operator

This is the 'or' operator allowing multiple validators to be used and
accepted. (Usage: rgb|rgba) <-- this would allow either rgb or rgba
colors to be accepted. This can also be combined with 'and' for example
( Usage: omitempty,rgb|rgba)

	Usage: |

# StructOnly

When a field that is a nested struct is encountered, and contains this flag
any validation on the nested struct will be run, but none of the nested
struct fields will be validated. This is useful if inside of your program
you know the struct will be valid, but need to verify it has been assigned.
NOTE: only "required" and "omitempty" can be used on a struct itself.

	Usage: structonly

# NoStructLevel

Same as structonly tag except that any struct level validations will not run.

	Usage: nostructlevel

# Omit Empty

Allows conditional validation, for example if a field is not set with
a value (Determined by the "required" validator) then other validation
such as min or max won't run, but if a value is set validation will run.

	Usage: omitempty

# Omit Nil

Allows to skip the validation if the value is nil (same as omitempty, but
only for the nil-values).

	Usage: omitnil

# Dive

This tells the validator to dive into a slice, array or map and validate that
level of the slice, array or map with the validation tags that follow.
Multidimensional nesting is also supported, each level you wish to dive will
require another dive tag. dive has some sub-tags, 'keys' & 'endkeys', please see
the Keys & EndKeys section just below.

	Usage: dive

Example #1

	[][]string with validation tag "gt=0,dive,len=1,dive,required"
	// gt=0 will be applied to []
	// len=1 will be applied to []string
	// required will be applied to string

Example #2

	[][]string with validation tag "gt=0,dive,dive,required"
	// gt=0 will be applied to []
	// []string will be spared validation
	// required will be applied to string

Keys & EndKeys

These are to be used together directly after the dive tag and tells the validator
that anything between 'keys' and 'endkeys' applies to the keys of a map and not the
values; think of it like the 'dive' tag, but for map keys instead of values.
Multidimensional nesting is also supported, each level you wish to validate will
require another 'keys' and 'endkeys' tag. These tags are only valid for maps.

	Usage: dive,keys,othertagvalidation(s),endkeys,valuevalidationtags

Example #1

	map[string]string with validation tag "gt=0,dive,keys,eq=1|eq=2,endkeys,required"
	// gt=0 will be applied to the map itself
	// eq=1|eq=2 will be applied to the map keys
	// required will be applied to map values

Example #2

	map[[2]string]string with validation tag "gt=0,dive,keys,dive,eq=1|eq=2,endkeys,required"
	// gt=0 will be applied to the map itself
	// eq=1|eq=2 will be applied to each array element in the map keys
	// required will be applied to map values

# Alias Validators and Tags

Alias Validators and Tags
NOTE: When returning an error, the tag returned in "FieldError" will be
the alias tag unless the dive tag is part of the alias. Everything after the
dive tag is not reported as the alias tag. Also, the "ActualTag" in the before
case will be the actual tag within the alias that failed.

Here is a list of the current built in alias tags:

	"iscolor"
		alias is "hexcolor|rgb|rgba|hsl|hsla" (Usage: iscolor)
	"country_code"
		alias is "iso3166_1_alpha2|iso3166_1_alpha3|iso3166_1_alpha_numeric" (Usage: country_code)

Validator notes:

	regex
		a regex validator won't be added because commas and = signs can be part
		of a regex which conflict with the validation definitions. Although
		workarounds can be made, they take away from using pure regex's.
		Furthermore it's quick and dirty but the regex's become harder to
		maintain and are not reusable, so it's as much a programming philosophy
		as anything.

		In place of this new validator functions should be created; a regex can
		be used within the validator function and even be precompiled for better
		efficiency within regexes.go.

		And the best reason, you can submit a pull request and we can keep on
		adding to the validation library of this package!

# Non standard validators

A collection of validation rules that are frequently needed but are more
complex than the ones found in the baked in validators.
A non standard validator must be registered manually like you would
with your own custom validation functions.

Example of registration and use:

	type Test struct {
		TestField string `validate:"yourtag"`
	}

	t := &Test{
		TestField: "Test"
	}

	validate := validator.New()
	validate.RegisterValidation("yourtag", validators.NotBlank)

Here is a list of the current non standard validators:

	NotBlank
		This validates that the value is not blank or with length zero.
		For strings ensures they do not contain only spaces. For channels, maps, slices and arrays
		ensures they don't have zero length. For others, a non empty value is required.

		Usage: notblank

# Panics

This package panics when bad input is provided, this is by design, bad code like
that should not make it to production.

	type Test struct {
		TestField string `validate:"nonexistantfunction=1"`
	}

	t := &Test{
		TestField: "Test"
	}

	validate.Struct(t) // this will panic
