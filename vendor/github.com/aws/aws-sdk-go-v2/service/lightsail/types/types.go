	//   provide the required information, use the [Amazon Web Services Support Center]to contact Amazon Web Services

	//   visit the [Amazon Web Services Support Center]and create a case.
	//
	//   - INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN - One or more of the domain names in the certificate
	//   request is not valid. Typically, this is because a domain name in the request is
	//   not a valid top-level domain. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any
	//   spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request, and ensure that all

	//
	//   - ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED - Lightsail requires additional information
	//   to process this certificate request. This can happen as a fraud-protection
	//   measure, such as when the domain ranks within the Alexa top 1000 websites. To
	//   provide the required information, use the [AWS Support Center]to contact AWS Support.
	//
	// You cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain names such as those
	//   ending in amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.
	//
	//   - DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED - One or more of the domain names in the certificate
	//   request was reported as an unsafe domain by [VirusTotal]. To correct the problem, search
	//   for your domain name on the [VirusTotal]website. If your domain is reported as
	//   suspicious, see [Google Help for Hacked Websites]to learn what you can do.
	//
	// If you believe that the result is a false positive, notify the organization
	//   that is reporting the domain. VirusTotal is an aggregate of several antivirus
	//   and URL scanners and cannot remove your domain from a block list itself. After
	//   you correct the problem and the VirusTotal registry has been updated, request a
	//   new certificate.
	//
	// If you see this error and your domain is not included in the VirusTotal list,
	//   visit the [AWS Support Center]and create a case.
	//
	//   - INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN - One or more of the domain names in the certificate
	//   request is not valid. Typically, this is because a domain name in the request is
	//   not a valid top-level domain. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any
	//   spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request, and ensure that all
	//   domain names in the request are for valid top-level domains. For example, you
	//   cannot request a certificate for example.invalidpublicdomain because
	//   invalidpublicdomain is not a valid top-level domain.
	//
	//   - OTHER - Typically, this failure occurs when there is a typographical error
	//   in one or more of the domain names in the certificate request. Try to request a
	//   certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the

	//   Prior communications are not required to set up transmission channels or data
	//   paths. Applications that don't require reliable data stream service can use UDP,

	//   instead.
	//
	//   - icmp - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to send error
	//   messages and operational information indicating success or failure when
	//   communicating with an instance. For example, an error is indicated when an
	//   instance could not be reached. When you specify icmp as the protocol , you

// the Route 53 hosted zone for the domain.
//

// be successful:
//
//   - The registered domain must be in the same Amazon Web Services account as
//     the Lightsail account making the request.

//   - The user or entity making the request must have permission to manage
//     domains in Route 53.
//
//   - The Route 53 hosted zone for the domain must be empty. It cannot contain
//     DNS records other than start of authority (SOA) and name server records.
//
// If automatic domain delegation fails, or if you manage the DNS of your domain
// using a service other than Route 53, then you must manually add the Lightsail
// DNS zone name servers to your domain in order to delegate management of its DNS
// to Lightsail. For more information, see [Creating a DNS zone to manage your domain’s records in Amazon Lightsail]in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide.
