	// The number of cpu units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to
	// CpuShares in the docker container create command and the --cpu-shares option to
	// docker run.
	//
	// This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only
	// requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a
	// task be lower than the task-level cpu value.
	//
	// You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance
	// type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the [Amazon EC2 Instances]detail page
	// by 1,024.
	//
	// Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the
	// container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example,
	// if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU
	// units specified for that container, and that's the only task running on the
	// container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at
	// any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that
	// container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when
	// needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other
	// container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they
	// would be limited to 512 CPU units.
	//
	// On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses
	// the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers.
	// The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2, and the
	// maximum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 262144. However,
	// the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 or above
	// 262144 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null) or
	// above 262144, the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent
	// version:
	//
	//   - Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are
	//   passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU
	//   values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two
	//   CPU shares.
	//
	//   - Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values
	//   of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.
	//
	//   - Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.84.0: CPU values greater than 256
	//   vCPU are passed to Docker as 256, which is equivalent to 262144 CPU shares.
	//
	// On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit,
	// or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU
	// that's described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to
	// Docker as 0 , which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.

	// provide a CredSpec with an additional section for a secret in Secrets Manager.
	// You provide the login credentials to the domain in the secret.
	//
	// Each task that runs on any container instance can join different domains.
	//
	// You can use this format without joining the container instance to a domain.
	//
	// credentialspec:MyARN You use credentialspec:MyARN to provide a CredSpec for a
	// single domain.
	//
	// You must join the container instance to the domain before you start any tasks
	// that use this task definition.
	//
	// In both formats, replace MyARN with the ARN in SSM or Amazon S3.
	//
	// If you provide a credentialspecdomainless:MyARN , the credspec must provide a
	// ARN in Secrets Manager for a secret containing the username, password, and the
	// domain to connect to. For better security, the instance isn't joined to the

	// to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks.
	//
	// If any tasks are unhealthy and if maximumPercent doesn't allow the Amazon ECS

	//
	// For services that do not use a load balancer, the following should be noted:
	//
	//   - A service is considered healthy if all essential containers within the
	//   tasks in the service pass their health checks.
	//
	//   - If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the
	//   service scheduler will wait for 40 seconds after a task reaches a RUNNING
	//   state before the task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent total.
	//
	//   - If a task has one or more essential containers with a health check defined,
	//   the service scheduler will wait for the task to reach a healthy status before
	//   counting it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered
	//   healthy when all essential containers within the task have passed their health
	//   checks. The amount of time the service scheduler can wait for is determined by
	//   the container health check settings.
	//
	// For services that do use a load balancer, the following should be noted:
	//
	//   - If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the
	//   service scheduler will wait for the load balancer target group health check to
	//   return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy
	//   percent total.
	//
	//   - If a task has an essential container with a health check defined, the
	//   service scheduler will wait for both the task to reach a healthy status and the
	//   load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before
	//   counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.
	//
	// The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The
	// default minimumHealthyPercent value for a service using the DAEMON service
	// schedule is 0% for the CLI, the Amazon Web Services SDKs, and the APIs and 50%
	// for the Amazon Web Services Management Console.
	//

	//   running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon ECS adds or
	//   removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by the service

	//
	//   - BLUE_GREEN - A blue/green deployment strategy ( BLUE_GREEN ) is a release
	//   methodology that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production
	//   environments called blue and green. With Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, you
	//   can validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them.

	//   - LINEAR - A linear deployment strategy ( LINEAR ) gradually shifts traffic
	//   from the current production environment to a new environment in equal
	//   percentages over time. With Amazon ECS linear deployments, you can control the
	//   pace of traffic shifting and validate new service revisions with increasing
	//   amounts of production traffic.
	//
	//   - CANARY - A canary deployment strategy ( CANARY ) shifts a small percentage

	//
	// When you create a service which uses the ECS deployment controller, you can
	//   choose between the following deployment strategies:
	//
	//   - ROLLING : When you create a service which uses the rolling update ( ROLLING

	//   running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon ECS adds or
	//   removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by the service
	//   deployment configuration.
	//
	// Rolling update deployments are best suited for the following scenarios:
	//
	//   - Gradual service updates: You need to update your service incrementally
	//   without taking the entire service offline at once.
	//
	//   - Limited resource requirements: You want to avoid the additional resource
	//   costs of running two complete environments simultaneously (as required by
	//   blue/green deployments).
	//
	//   - Acceptable deployment time: Your application can tolerate a longer
	//   deployment process, as rolling updates replace tasks one by one.
	//
	//   - No need for instant roll back: Your service can tolerate a rollback process
	//   that takes minutes rather than seconds.
	//
	//   - Simple deployment process: You prefer a straightforward deployment approach
	//   without the complexity of managing multiple environments, target groups, and
	//   listeners.
	//
	//   - No load balancer requirement: Your service doesn't use or require a load
	//   balancer, Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Service Connect
	//   (which are required for blue/green deployments).
	//
	//   - Stateful applications: Your application maintains state that makes it
	//   difficult to run two parallel environments.
	//
	//   - Cost sensitivity: You want to minimize deployment costs by not running
	//   duplicate environments during deployment.
	//
	// Rolling updates are the default deployment strategy for services and provide a

// of docker run.
//
// The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks
// specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health
// checks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container
// definition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition
// override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.
//
// You can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with
// the DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in the console.
//
// The health check is designed to make sure that your containers survive agent
// restarts, upgrades, or temporary unavailability.
//
// Amazon ECS performs health checks on containers with the default that launched
// the container instance or the task.
//
// The following describes the possible healthStatus values for a container:
//
//   - HEALTHY -The container health check has passed successfully.
//
//   - UNHEALTHY -The container health check has failed.
//
//   - UNKNOWN -The container health check is being evaluated, there's no container
//     health check defined, or Amazon ECS doesn't have the health status of the
//     container.
//
// The following describes the possible healthStatus values based on the container
// health checker status of essential containers in the task with the following
// priority order (high to low):
//
//   - UNHEALTHY -One or more essential containers have failed their health check.
//
//   - UNKNOWN -Any essential container running within the task is in an UNKNOWN
//     state and no other essential containers have an UNHEALTHY state.
//
//   - HEALTHY -All essential containers within the task have passed their health
//     checks.
//
// Consider the following task health example with 2 containers.
//
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , the task health is
//     UNHEALTHY .
//
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY , the task health is
//     UNHEALTHY .
//
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , the task health is
//     UNKNOWN .
//
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY , the task health is
//     HEALTHY .
//
// Consider the following task health example with 3 containers.
//
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , and Container3 is
//     UNKNOWN , the task health is UNHEALTHY .
//
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , and Container3 is
//     HEALTHY , the task health is UNHEALTHY .
//
//   - If Container1 is UNHEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY , and Container3 is
//     HEALTHY , the task health is UNHEALTHY .
//
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , and Container3 is
//     HEALTHY , the task health is UNKNOWN .
//
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is UNKNOWN , and Container3 is
//     UNKNOWN , the task health is UNKNOWN .
//
//   - If Container1 is HEALTHY and Container2 is HEALTHY , and Container3 is
//     HEALTHY , the task health is HEALTHY .
//
// If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue
// its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of a
// service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped and the
// service scheduler will replace it.
//
// When a container health check fails for a task that is part of a service, the
// following process occurs:
//
//   - The task is marked as UNHEALTHY .
//
//   - The unhealthy task will be stopped, and during the stopping process, it
//     will go through the following states:
//
//   - DEACTIVATING - In this state, Amazon ECS performs additional steps before
//     stopping the task. For example, for tasks that are part of services configured
//     to use Elastic Load Balancing target groups, target groups will be deregistered
//     in this state.
//
//   - STOPPING - The task is in the process of being stopped.
//
//   - DEPROVISIONING - Resources associated with the task are being cleaned up.
//
//   - STOPPED - The task has been completely stopped.
//
//   - After the old task stops, a new task will be launched to ensure service
//     operation, and the new task will go through the following lifecycle:
//
//   - PROVISIONING - Resources required for the task are being provisioned.
//
//   - PENDING - The task is waiting to be placed on a container instance.
//
//   - ACTIVATING - In this state, Amazon ECS pulls container images, creates
//     containers, configures task networking, registers load balancer target groups,
//     and configures service discovery status.
//
//   - RUNNING - The task is running and performing its work.
//
// For more detailed information about task lifecycle states, see [Task lifecycle] in the Amazon
// Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
//
// The following are notes about container health check support:
//
//   - If the Amazon ECS container agent becomes disconnected from the Amazon ECS
//     service, this won't cause a container to transition to an UNHEALTHY status.
//     This is by design, to ensure that containers remain running during agent
//     restarts or temporary unavailability. The health check status is the "last heard
//     from" response from the Amazon ECS agent, so if the container was considered
//     HEALTHY prior to the disconnect, that status will remain until the agent
//     reconnects and another health check occurs. There are no assumptions made about
//     the status of the container health checks.
//
//   - Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon ECS
//     container agent. For more information, see [Updating the Amazon ECS container agent].
//
//   - Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using
//     platform version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see [Fargate platform versions].
//
//   - Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of a
//     service that's configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.
//

// where container dependency is specified, see [Container dependency]in the Amazon Elastic Container

	// specified prefix, the container name, and the ID of the Amazon ECS task that the
	// container belongs to. If you specify a prefix with this option, then the log
	// stream takes the format prefix-name/container-name/ecs-task-id .
	//
	// If you don't specify a prefix with this option, then the log stream is named
	// after the container ID that's assigned by the Docker daemon on the container
	// instance. Because it's difficult to trace logs back to the container that sent
	// them with just the Docker container ID (which is only available on the container
	// instance), we recommend that you specify a prefix with this option.
	//
	// For Amazon ECS services, you can use the service name as the prefix. Doing so,
	// you can trace log streams to the service that the container belongs to, the name
	// of the container that sent them, and the ID of the task that the container
	// belongs to.
	//
	// You must specify a stream-prefix for your logs to have your logs appear in the
	// Log pane when using the Amazon ECS console.
	//
	// awslogs-datetime-format Required: No
	//
	// This option defines a multiline start pattern in Python strftime format. A log
	// message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines that
	// don’t match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log messages.
	//
	// One example of a use case for using this format is for parsing output such as a
	// stack dump, which might otherwise be logged in multiple entries. The correct
	// pattern allows it to be captured in a single entry.
	//
	// For more information, see [awslogs-datetime-format].
	//
	// You cannot configure both the awslogs-datetime-format and
	// awslogs-multiline-pattern options.
	//
	// Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log
	// messages. This might have a negative impact on logging performance.
	//
	// awslogs-multiline-pattern Required: No
	//
	// This option defines a multiline start pattern that uses a regular expression. A
	// log message consists of a line that matches the pattern and any following lines
	// that don’t match the pattern. The matched line is the delimiter between log
	// messages.
	//
	// For more information, see [awslogs-multiline-pattern].
	//
	// This option is ignored if awslogs-datetime-format is also configured.
	//
	// You cannot configure both the awslogs-datetime-format and
	// awslogs-multiline-pattern options.
	//
	// Multiline logging performs regular expression parsing and matching of all log
	// messages. This might have a negative impact on logging performance.
	//
	// The following options apply to all supported log drivers.
	//
	// mode Required: No
	//
	// Valid values: non-blocking | blocking
	//
	// This option defines the delivery mode of log messages from the container to the
	// log driver specified using logDriver . The delivery mode you choose affects
	// application availability when the flow of logs from container is interrupted.
	//
	// If you use the blocking mode and the flow of logs is interrupted, calls from
	// container code to write to the stdout and stderr streams will block. The
	// logging thread of the application will block as a result. This may cause the
	// application to become unresponsive and lead to container healthcheck failure.
	//
	// If you use the non-blocking mode, the container's logs are instead stored in an
	// in-memory intermediate buffer configured with the max-buffer-size option. This
	// prevents the application from becoming unresponsive when logs cannot be sent. We
	// recommend using this mode if you want to ensure service availability and are
	// okay with some log loss. For more information, see [Preventing log loss with non-blocking mode in the awslogs container log driver]awslogs .
	//
	// You can set a default mode for all containers in a specific Amazon Web Services
	// Region by using the defaultLogDriverMode account setting. If you don't specify
	// the mode option or configure the account setting, Amazon ECS will default to
	// the non-blocking mode. For more information about the account setting, see [Default log driver mode] in
	// the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
	//
	// On June 25, 2025, Amazon ECS changed the default log driver mode from blocking
	// to non-blocking to prioritize task availability over logging. To continue using
	// the blocking mode after this change, do one of the following:
	//
	//   - Set the mode option in your container definition's logConfiguration as
	//   blocking .
	//
	//   - Set the defaultLogDriverMode account setting to blocking .
	//
	// max-buffer-size Required: No
	//
	// Default value: 10m
	//
	// When non-blocking mode is used, the max-buffer-size log option controls the
	// size of the buffer that's used for intermediate message storage. Make sure to
	// specify an adequate buffer size based on your application. When the buffer fills
	// up, further logs cannot be stored. Logs that cannot be stored are lost.
	//
	// To route logs using the splunk log router, you need to specify a splunk-token
	// and a splunk-url .
	//
	// When you use the awsfirelens log router to route logs to an Amazon Web Services
	// Service or Amazon Web Services Partner Network destination for log storage and
	// analytics, you can set the log-driver-buffer-limit option to limit the number
	// of events that are buffered in memory, before being sent to the log router
	// container. It can help to resolve potential log loss issue because high
	// throughput might result in memory running out for the buffer inside of Docker.
	//
	// Other options you can specify when using awsfirelens to route logs depend on
	// the destination. When you export logs to Amazon Data Firehose, you can specify
	// the Amazon Web Services Region with region and a name for the log stream with
	// delivery_stream .
	//
	// When you export logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, you can specify an Amazon
	// Web Services Region with region and a data stream name with stream .
	//
	// When you export logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service, you can specify options like
	// Name , Host (OpenSearch Service endpoint without protocol), Port , Index , Type
	// , Aws_auth , Aws_region , Suppress_Type_Name , and tls . For more information,
	// see [Under the hood: FireLens for Amazon ECS Tasks].
	//
	// When you export logs to Amazon S3, you can specify the bucket using the bucket
	// option. You can also specify region , total_file_size , upload_timeout , and
	// use_put_object as options.
	//
