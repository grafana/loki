# Sample Function

The following is a sample class and Lambda function that receives Amazon Kinesis event record data as an input and writes some of the record data to CloudWatch Logs. (Note that by default anything written to Console will be logged as CloudWatch Logs events.)

```go

package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)

func handler(ctx context.Context, kinesisEvent events.KinesisEvent) error {
    for _, record := range kinesisEvent.Records {
        kinesisRecord := record.Kinesis
        dataBytes := kinesisRecord.Data
        dataText := string(dataBytes)

        fmt.Printf("%s Data = %s \n", record.EventName, dataText) 
    }
    
    return nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(handler)
}

```
