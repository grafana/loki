# Sample Function

The following is a sample class and Lambda function that receives Amazon SES event message data as input, writes some of the message data to CloudWatch Logs, and responds with a 200 status and the same body as the request. (Note that by default anything written to Console will be logged as CloudWatch Logs events.)

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)

func handler(ctx context.Context, sesEvent events.SimpleEmailEvent) error {
  for _, record := range sesEvent.Records {
      ses := record.SES
      fmt.Printf("[%s - %s] Mail = %+v, Receipt = %+v \n", record.EventVersion, record.EventSource, ses.Mail, ses.Receipt)
  }

	return nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(handler)
}

```
