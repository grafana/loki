// Package sso provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Single Sign-On.
//
// Amazon Web Services Single Sign On Portal is a web service that makes it
// easy for you to assign user access to Amazon Web Services SSO resources such
// as the AWS access portal. Users can get Amazon Web Services account applications
// and roles assigned to them and get federated into the application.
//
// Although Amazon Web Services Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and identitystore
// API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for backward compatibility
// purposes. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SSO rename (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed).
//
// This API reference guide describes the Amazon Web Services SSO Portal operations
// that you can call programatically and includes detailed information on data
// types and errors.
//
// Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code
// for various programming languages and platforms, such as Java, Ruby, .Net,
// iOS, or Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
// access to Amazon Web Services SSO and other Amazon Web Services services.
// For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to
// download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/sso-2019-06-10 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Single Sign-On with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// information on creating client for this service.
